<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">My Dear Young Folks</span>,</p>

<p class="p1">Here are some more stories from the wonderful
Annals of Fairyland. How they were first told at the Court
of King Oberon, and how they came to be recorded you
will learn at the beginning, and much as you love the little
people you will, I think, like them even better when you
have learned all that this volume has to tell. Mr William
Canton has told you the stories properly belonging to “The
Reign of King Herla,” Mr J. M. Gibbon showed you how
a famous merry old soul and his court found entertainment
in story-telling in “The Reign of King Cole,” and now it is
my pleasant privilege to put before you, from the inexhaustible
Annals, those tales which properly belong to “The
Reign of King Oberon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">(viii)</span></p>

<p>Of course you may have already met some of these
stories before, for most of our best writers have been made
free of Fairyland and have written of the wonderful things
they learned there; Hans Christian Andersen and the
Brothers Grimm have long since been famous for all that
they have told of their visits to the marvellous land, and
some of the stories which they brought back will be found
to belong to the reign of Oberon and Titania, while others
have been told by Ben Jonson, by Thomas Hood, by
Charles Perrault, by Thomas Crofton Croker, by Douglas
Jerrold, by Benjamin Thorpe and by Sir George Dasent—but
old or new all have the perennial youthfulness of
the fairies themselves, and as long as we can truly enjoy
them we shall not grow old.</p>

<p class="dropcap">In all the annals of Fairyland
nothing is more wonderful—and
the annals are
found in many hundreds
of volumes—than that
chapter which tells of the
reign of the true fairy King
Oberon and his beautiful wife Titania, who is
sometimes called Queen Mab. Marvellous are
the doings of Oberon’s little subjects in every
land—good fairies and bad fairies, dwarfs,
elves and sprites, brownies, pixies and
gnomes, pucks, trolls and kobolds and
Robin Goodfellow—and marvellous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">(3)</span>
are the tales which have been told of them by travellers

<p>Now, once upon a time there was sadness throughout the
whole kingdom of Oberon—and his kingdom has no
boundaries—because of a quarrel which had arisen
between the king and the queen. It was a very small
matter to begin with, but the king was a king and did not
think it consorted with his dignity as such that his will
should not be law, while the lovely Queen Titania thought
that even the powerful king of the fairies should give way
to her wishes. A small Indian prince, a dusky child, son of
a mighty monarch of the East, had been stolen and a fairy
baby left in its place and King Oberon wanted the
changeling to be one of the knights of his train, while
Queen Titania insisted on keeping him as one of her
pages. Long and bitter was the quarrel but neither<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">(4)</span>
king nor queen would give way, and at length
they parted and half the fairies marched off under
the banner of the king and half under the banner
of the queen.</p>

</figure>

<p>Now you know of course that it was the fairies that
looked after all things, the flowers and the trees, the
streams and lakes, the little birds and beasts, and even—though
they might not be aware of it—after the doings
of many men and women; thus when it befel that their
king and queen quarrelled and all the fairies rallied to
their separate courts everything was neglected: the corn
died unripened, the grass withered in the fields, so that
the flocks and herds starved, the summers were cold and
wet, the winters were sickly and mild, and many good
men, women and children lost their tempers and became
troublesome and unhappy they knew not why, and certainly
never imagined that it was all because of a quarrel between
the rulers of the world-wide kingdom of Fairy.</p>

  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/image005.png"><img class="w100" src="images/image005_small.png" alt="" title="“The Fairyland buys not the child of me”"></a>
</figure>

<p>For a long time it seemed as though the king and
queen would not be reconciled. When they met Oberon
would say, “I do but beg a little changeling boy to be my
henchman”; and Titania would reply, “Set your heart at
rest, the Fairyland buys not the child of me.” And again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">(5)</span>
the king would say, “Give me the boy and I will go
with thee”; and the queen would answer, “Not for
thy fairy kingdom.” Luckily Oberon by means of his
fairy-arts was finally able to win his way and gain the
little changeling for his retinue, the king and queen were
reconciled and all the fairies returned to their happy
work: the crops and grass revived, flowers bloomed
everywhere, the birds sang, summer was once more
warm and sunny, and winter once more white and frosty,
while men, women and children suddenly regained their
good tempers, knowing as little why they did so as why
they had lost them. All the world was indeed once
again bright and happy as it should be. Great was the
rejoicing throughout the realm of Fairyland, and greater still
it became when King Oberon summoned to his court all
his subjects from all parts of the world to celebrate the
reconciliation. Quick as thought his wish was made
known by Ariel and Puck his ready messengers, and at
once all the little people were hurrying to obey the
monarch’s behest, and within the forty minutes which
Puck takes to put a girdle round about the earth all
had assembled. Then there was such a sight of wonderful
splendour as would have astonished human eyes: there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">(6)</span>
in beautiful colours were fairies from the flowers and the
rainbows, from streams and woodland, elves, dwarfs and
gnomes from caves under the earth where gold is hammered
and precious stones are made; there were pixies and
brownies and quaint little sprites innumerable; there was
Cinderella’s fairy godmother, and there was Allwise the
dwarf who wanted to marry Thor’s daughter; there was
Robin Goodfellow, and there was Ariel; there were Titania’s
attendant fairies Peaseblossom and Cobweb, Moth and
Mustardseed; there was Thumbeline and the fairy Prince
her husband, and Hop-o-my-Thumb, and Thumbling;
there were the King’s courtiers—Perriwiggin, Perriwincle,
Puck, Hob-Goblin, Tomalin and Tom-Thumb; there were
the Queen’s maids of honour—Hop, Mop, Drop, Pip,
Drip, Skip, Tub, Tib, Tick, Pink, Pin, Quick, Gill, Un,
Tit, Wap, Win, Wit with Nymphidia the mother of the
maids—but if I were to give you a list of all the different
fairies who gathered about Oberon’s court I should fill up
this book and leave no room for any stories or for Mr
Robinson’s illustrations.</p>

<p>There were, to put it shortly, all the fairies that ever
lived, all the fairies that you ever knew, told of in tales
or dreamed of in dreams, and a marvellous sight it would
have been if we could have seen them gathered about the
fairy palace of King Oberon. Everyone knew everyone
else, and many were the stories told of elfish mischief and
of benefits done to good people by their attendant fairies.
Oberon and Titania passing along, talking to their happy
subjects and attended by the changeling boy who had
caused so much trouble, overheard one of these stories, and
turning to his queen, the king said: “My Titania, shall
we not hear some of these stories which our people can
tell of their doings with men, women and children in the
world of big folk?” Titania readily agreed that it would
be delightful; and elfin trumpeters passed amid the
multitude and blew their horns, and said that all were
to arrange themselves in the great Fairy Ring and were
to be prepared to tell stories until the dawn. Then there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">(11)</span>
was a pretty hustling and bustling of merry crowds jostling
and soon all were arranged in circles about the great Fairy
Ring, and Oberon and Titania ascended a throne which
was beautifully formed of sweet-scented flowers that never
faded. At the foot of the throne a stool was placed, and
on it the story-tellers were to sit while amusing the Court;
such was the magic of the circle that though the fairy
speaking only addressed himself to the king and queen,
his voice was heard even by the fairies furthest away, on
the very outermost part of the ring. Happily for us the
changeling boy was there sitting on the steps of the throne,
and when, years afterwards, he found his way back to his
father’s kingdom, he wrote down all the wonderful stories he
had heard at the Court of King Oberon, and they have
since been translated into many tongues by many writers,
so that some of them will no doubt be familiar to you.
Here, however, we have the stories just as Oberon’s
changeling wrote them down, and the first story was
repeated by a Scandinavian dwarf out of the cold north,
who told how it was that the great hero Thor got</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="the_gifts_of_the_dwarfs">The Gifts of the Dwarfs</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Thor was, as you know, the strongest and
noblest of the great giants of the north. He
was tall in stature and had fiery brown eyes,
from which the light flashed like lightning,
while his long red beard waved through the
sky as he drove in his goat-drawn chariot.
Brilliant sparks flew from the hoofs and teeth
of the two goats, while a crown of bright stars
shone above Thor’s head. When he was angered
the wheels of his chariot rumbled and crashed
their passage through the air, until men trembled and hid,
telling each other that Thor had gone to battle with the
Rime-giants or other of his enemies. Now Thor’s wife
was named Sib, and she was most beautiful to look upon.
Her soft, browny-gold hair was so long and thick that it
would cover her from the crown of her head to her little
feet, and her deep brown eyes looked into the faces of
her friends as those of a mother look into the face of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">(13)</span>
her child. Loki, the mischief-maker among the giants,
often looked at Sib and longed to do her some evil,
for he was jealous, thinking that it was not right that
she should be praised and loved by everyone; go where
he would he could find no one who did not speak well
of her.</p>

<p>It happened one day when the summer was nearly gone
that Loki found Sib alone and sleeping on a bank near the
river, so he drew his knife, and creeping softly nearer and
nearer, cut off her beautiful flowing hair quite close to her
head. Then he joyfully rushed away and strewed it far
and wide over the whole earth, so that it became no longer
living and golden but faded and turned a dull colour as
the winds blew it about and the rains beat upon it, and
crushed it in between the rocks and stones. When Sib
awoke and was about to push the hair from her face, she
felt that something was wrong. Wonderingly she ran to
the water and looking at her reflection in the clear depths,
saw that nothing but a short stubble stood up all over
her head. All her lovely hair was gone! Only one
would have dared to treat her so badly, and in her grief
and anger she called upon Thor to come to her aid.</p>

<p>Loki had of course fled and was hiding far away in
another country among the rocks when he heard the
distant rumblings of thunder, and tried to shrink deeper
into the crevices between the great stones, but the awful
sound grew louder, and at last the angry flash from Thor’s
eyes darted to the very spot where the mischievous one
lay. Then Thor pulled him out and shook him from
side to side in his enormous hands, and would have
crushed his bones upon the hard rocks had not Loki
in great terror asked what good his death would do, for
it certainly would not bring Sib’s hair back. Then Thor
set the mischief-maker on his feet, though still keeping
a tight hold on him, and asked what he would do to
repair the evil which he had done. Loki promptly
answered that he would go down into the mountains to
the dwarfs, and get Iwald’s sons to make some golden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">(14)</span>
hair for Sib, as good as that which he had destroyed.
Now Iwald had had seven sons, and these all lived
deep below the earth in the great caverns which lie
below the mountains, and these sons were small and
dark; they did not like the daylight for they were little
dwarfs who could see best without the sun to dazzle
their eyes; they knew where gold and silver grew, and
they could tell where to find beautiful shining stones,
which were red, and white, and yellow, and green; they
knew the way all over the world by running through
caverns and passages under the mountains, and wherever
they could find precious stones or metals they built a
furnace, and made an anvil, and hammer and bellows,
and everything that was wanted in a smithy; for they
knew how to fashion the most wonderful things from
gold and iron and stone, and they had knowledge which
made them more powerful than the people who lived
above the ground.</p>

<p>Thor let the mischief-maker go to get the help of the
dwarfs to repair the wrong which he had done, and Loki
sought about the mountain-side until he found a hole
which would lead him into Iwald’s cave, and then he
promptly dropped into it. There in a dark cave gleaming
with many sparkling lights he went to the two cleverest
dwarfs who were named Sindri and Brok, and told them
what it was he wanted, adding that he would be in sore
trouble with Thor if they could not help him. Now
Sindri and Brok knew all about Loki perfectly well; they
knew all about his mischievous ways and the evil he so
often wrought, but as they liked Thor and Sib they were
willing to give the help which was asked of them. Thus
without more ado, for these dwarfs never wasted their
words, Sindri and Brok began their work.</p>

<p>Huge blocks of earth-brown stone were cast into the
furnace until they were in a white heat, when drop by drop
red gold trickled from them into the ashes. This was all
gathered together, and the glistening heap taken to the
dwarf women, who, crushing it in their hands before it had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">(15)</span>
hardened, drew it out upon their wheels, and spun it into
fine soft hair. While they were doing this Brok sought
amongst his treasures until he found the blue of the ocean
and the tough inner pith of an underground tree; these,
with other things, were cast into the furnace, and afterwards
beaten with his hammer. As the rhythmic strokes fell,
the women sang a song which was like the voice of a
strong, steady wind. Then when this work was finished,
the smith drew forth a little ship, which was carefully
placed on one side. The third time the dwarf went to a
dark corner, and brought out an ugly bent bar of iron,
and this, with two feathers from the wings of the wind,
was heated to melting whiteness, and wrought with great
cunning and extreme care, for it was to be a spear for
Odin himself, the greatest of all the Heroes.</p>

<p>Then Brok and Sindri called Loki to them and giving
him these three things bade him hasten back to the
Heroes at Asgard and appease their wrath. Loki, however,
was already beginning to feel sorry that he had been so
successful; he liked teasing folk but he did not like
having to atone for his mischief afterwards. He turned
the marvellous gifts over scornfully in his hands, and said
that he did not see anything very wonderful in <em>them</em>;
then, looking at Sindri he added, “However, Brok has
hammered them very skilfully, and I will wager my head
that you could not make anything better.”</p>

<p>Now the brother dwarfs had not by any means expected
gratitude, but neither had they expected any such rudeness
as this, so Sindri determined to give Loki a lesson. Going
to one corner of the smithy he picked up a pig-skin and
taking the hammer in his hands, told his brother to blow
steadily, neither to falter nor to fail until he passed the
word that the work was done. Then with strength and
gentleness he wrought with his tools, having cast nothing
into the heat but the pig-skin; with mighty blows and
delicate touches he brought thickness and substance into
it, until a boar looked at him from the flames. Loki,
fearing for his head, changed himself into an enormous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">(16)</span>
forest fly, and settling upon Brok’s hand, stung with
vicious fury; but the dwarf would not trouble to brush the
fly away, and steadily moved the bellows until his brother
called to him to stop, when they drew forth a strong
flexible boar whose bristles were of the finest gold.</p>

<p>Then without saying anything or paying any attention to
the spiteful words which Loki kept uttering, Sindri chose
from a heap of gold the most solid lump he could find
and flung it into the white flames. Thrice it was heated
and cooled, and the dark elf turned it and worked it with
wonderful skill, and in the glow Loki saw a broad red ring,
which seemed to live and move. Again he tried to spoil
the work as a fly, and bit deeply into Brok’s neck, but
Brok would not so much as raise his hand to rid him of
the pain. When the ring was finally laid to cool, so
marvellously had it been wrought that from it each ninth
night would fall eight rings as beautiful as itself.</p>

<p>Now came the last test of Sindri’s cunning. He cast
into the furnace a piece of fine iron, and told Brok his
hand must neither tremble nor stay, or the whole of their
work would be useless. Then with wild songs of strength
upon his lips he hammered and tapped, until those who
were in the cave felt that they were out among the roaring
waves; they could hear the ice mountains grind and crash
to pieces, and the thunder of Thor’s chariot wheels rushing
through the heavens. A frenzied horror seized upon
Loki’s mind. If these wretched dwarfs were going to
make anything to add to Thor’s strength he knew that it
would be his own ruin. So, changing himself to a hornet,
he sprang upon the forehead of Brok, and dug so fiercely
into his eyelids that the blood trickled down and blinded
him. Then the dwarf let go of the bellows for one
moment to clear his eyes, and Sindri cried out that what
lay in the furnace came near to being spoiled, and with
that he took a red-hot hammer up with his tongs. It was
neither pretty, nor particularly large, while the handle was
an inch too short because of Loki’s spite.</p>

<p>Then Brok and Loki set out for Asgard, Loki carrying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">(19)</span>
the three wonderful things which had been given to him,
while Brok carried the three marvels which Sindri had so
cunningly wrought and accompanied the mischief-maker,
that the Heroes might judge who had won the wager so
rashly offered by Loki. When they reached Asgard the
Heroes seated themselves on their high seats agreeing
among themselves that Odin, Thor and Frey should be
judges in this case.</p>

<div class="chapter fullpage">
<figure class="figcenter illowp40 fullpage" id="image017">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/image017.png"><img class="fullpage" src="images/image017_small.png" alt="" title="Loki descending into the cave of the dwarfs"></a>
</figure>
</div>

<p>First, Loki offered to Odin the spear Gungner which
was so wonderfully made that it never failed to hit the
thing at which it was thrown, and it always sped back to
the hand which had thrown it. Later, when Odin carried
this spear in battle, if he shook it over his enemies they
became so frightened that they all wanted to run away,
but if he shook it over his friends they were so filled with
courage that they could not be conquered. Then Thor
received the hair, and when it was placed upon Sib’s head
it grew to her like living tresses, curling and waving in the
wind. To Frey the ship was given, and though it was so
small that it could be folded and carried in his pocket,
when it was placed upon the waves it would grow large
enough to hold an army of warriors with all their war gear;
besides, as soon as the sails were hoisted, the wind would
blow it whithersoever it was desired that the ship should go.</p>

<p>Brok then made his offerings, and to Odin he gave the
ring Draupnir which had been made with such magic skill
that every ninth night eight other rings dropped off it,
though no one could see how they came; this the greatest
of the Heroes ever wore upon his arm, until the death of
his beautiful son Balder, when, as token of his great love
he placed it upon the dead youth’s breast as he lay on his
funeral pyre. To Frey was given the golden boar, which
would run faster than any horse, over the sea or through
the air, and wherever it went, there it would be light,
because the bristles shone so brightly. To Thor Brok
gave the dull-looking hammer, saying, that whatever he
struck with it would be destroyed; that no blow could be
hard enough to hurt it; that if he threw it, it would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">(20)</span>
return to him so that he could never lose it; and that as he
wished so would its size be—yet there was one fault about
it, and that was that the handle was an inch too short.</p>

<p>It was with great joy that Thor took this treasure,
knowing that in it he had something to help him in
fighting the evil Rime-giants who were always trying to get
the whole world for themselves until driven back by him.</p>

<p>Then the Heroes decided that of all the gifts the hammer
was the best, and that, therefore, Loki had lost his wager
and must lose his head. Loki offered to give all sorts of
things to save himself, but the dwarf would not listen to
any of them. “Catch me, then!” cried the mischievous
one; but when Brok stretched his hand upon him Loki
had gone, for he wore shoes which would carry him over
the sea or through the air.</p>

<p>“Catch him!” cried the ugly little dwarf piteously to
Thor, and in an instant Loki stood before them, trembling
in Thor’s strong grasp. Then the clever one argued that
it was his head only which had been wagered, and that not
one little tiny bit of his neck might be taken, or the dwarf
would have more than his bargain. At this Brok cried
impatiently that the head of a wicked person was of no
use to him, all that he wanted
was to stop Loki’s tongue so
that he could work less evil,
and he took a knife and thread
and tried to pierce holes in
Loki’s lips, but Loki bewitched
the knife so that it
would not cut.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp20" id="image020">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/image020.png"><img class="w100" src="images/image020_small.png" alt="" title="Loki’s punishment"></a>
</figure>

<p>“If only I had Sindri’s
awl,” sighed the dwarf, and
instantly his brother’s awl
was in his hand. Swiftly it
pierced the lips of the mischief-maker,
and swiftly Brok sewed them together and
broke off the thread at the end of the sewing.</p>

<p>Then the Heroes gave presents for the dwarfs in return<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">(21)</span>
for their wonderful things, and Brok returned to his cave.
As for Loki, I think that it was not long before he loosed
his lips and returned to his mischief-making.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>When the Scandinavian dwarf ceased speaking there was
murmuring all over the circle at the meannesses of Loki,
and everyone felt glad that Thor had been so well served
by the dwarfs and hoped that the mischief-maker, though
he escaped that time after all, later met with the reward
which he deserved. I think that if the Scandinavian dwarf
had chosen to do so he might have told a very grim story of
how it was that the wicked Loki came to his fate at last,
but there were so many fairies, dwarfs, fays, gnomes,
trolls, pucks, and other little people who were ready to
tell stories that I don’t think that they would have let the
Scandinavian dwarf tell another story if he had wanted to.
When he went back to his place in the great circle, the
little fairy prince of a bright warm country sprang
on to the stool in front of Oberon’s throne and
said that he would be glad to tell the story of his
wife’s life, and how it was that she came to marry
him.</p>

<p>“And what is your wife’s name?” said Oberon.</p>

<p>“Her name,” answered the little
prince, “is</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="thumbeline">Thumbeline</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent">There was once a woman who had the greatest longing
for a little tiny child, but she had no idea where to get one; so
she went to an old witch and said to her, “I do so long to
have a little child, will you tell me where I can get one?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we shall be able to manage that,” said the witch.
“Here is a barley corn for you; it is not at all the same
kind as that which grows in the peasant’s field, or with
which chickens are fed; plant it in a flower-pot and you
will see what will appear.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, oh, thank you!” said the woman, and she
gave the witch twelve pennies, then went home and planted
the barley corn, and a large, handsome flower sprang up
at once; it looked exactly like a tulip, but the petals were
tightly shut up, just as if they were still in bud. “That is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">(23)</span>
a lovely flower,” said the woman, and she kissed the pretty
red and yellow petals; as she kissed it the flower burst
open with a loud snap. It was a real tulip, you could see
that; but right in the middle of the flower on the green stool
sat a little tiny girl, most lovely and delicate; she was not
more than an inch in height, so she was called Thumbeline.</p>

<p>Her cradle was a smartly varnished walnut shell, with
the blue petals of violets for a mattress and a rose-leaf to
cover her; she slept in it at night, but during the day she
played about on the table where the woman had placed a
plate, surrounded by a wreath of flowers on the outer edge
with their stalks in water. A large tulip petal floated on
the water, and on this little Thumbeline sat and sailed about
from one side of the plate to the other; she had two white
horse hairs for oars. It was a pretty sight. She could sing,
too, with such delicacy and charm as was never heard before.</p>

<p>One night as she lay in her pretty bed, a great ugly toad
hopped in at the window, for there was a broken pane.
Ugh! how hideous that great wet toad was; it hopped
right down on to the table where Thumbeline lay fast
asleep, under the red rose-leaf.</p>

<p>“Here is a lovely wife for my son,” said the toad, and
then she took up the walnut shell where Thumbeline slept
and hopped away with it through the window, down into
the garden. A great broad stream ran through it, but
just at the edge it was swampy and muddy, and it was here
that the toad lived with her son. Ugh! how ugly and
hideous he was too, exactly like his mother. “Koax,
koax, brekke-ke-kex,” that was all he had to say when he
saw the lovely little girl in the walnut shell.</p>

<p>“Do not talk so loud or you will wake her,” said the
old toad; “she might escape us yet, for she is as light as
thistledown! We will put her on one of the broad water-lily
leaves out in the stream; it will be just like an island
to her, she is so small and light. She won’t be able to run
away from there while we get the state-room ready down
under the mud, which you are to inhabit.”</p>

<p>A great many water-lilies grew in the stream, their broad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">(24)</span>
green leaves looked as if they were floating on the surface
of the water. The leaf which was furthest from the shore
was also the biggest, and to this one the old toad swam out
with the walnut shell in which little Thumbeline lay.</p>

<p>The poor, tiny, little creature woke up quite early in the
morning, and when she saw where she was she began to
cry most bitterly, for there was water on every side of the
big green leaf, and she could not reach the land at any point.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp40" id="image024">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/image024.png"><img class="w100" src="images/image024_small.png" alt="" title="The old toad made a deep curtsey in the water before her"></a>
</figure>

<p>The old toad sat in the mud decking out her abode with
grasses and the buds of the yellow water-lilies, so as to
have it very nice for the new daughter-in-law, and then she
swam out with her ugly son to the leaf where Thumbeline
stood; they wanted to fetch her pretty bed to place it in
the bridal chamber before they took her there. The
old toad made a deep curtsey in the water before her, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">(25)</span>
said, “Here is my son, who is to be your husband, and
you are to live together most comfortably down in the
mud.”</p>

<p>“Koax, koax, brekke-ke-kex,” that was all the son
could say.</p>

<p>Then they took the pretty little bed and swam away with
it, but Thumbeline sat quite alone on the green leaf and
cried because she did not want to live with the ugly toad,
or have her horrid son for a husband. The little fish
which swam about in the water had no doubt seen the
toad and heard what she said, so they stuck their heads up,
wishing, I suppose, to see the little girl. As soon as they
saw her, they were delighted with her, and were quite
grieved to think that she was to go down to live with the
ugly toad. No, that should never happen. They flocked
together down in the water round about the green stem
which held the leaf she stood upon, and gnawed at it with
their teeth till it floated away down the stream carrying
Thumbeline away where the toad could not follow her.</p>

<p>Thumbeline sailed past place after place, and the little
birds in the bushes saw her and sang, “What a lovely little
maid.” The leaf with her on it floated further and further
away and in this manner reached foreign lands.</p>

<p>A pretty little white butterfly fluttered round and round
her for some time and at last settled on the leaf, for it had
taken quite a fancy to Thumbeline; she was so happy now,
because the toad could not reach her and she was sailing
through such lovely scenes; the sun shone on the water
and it looked like liquid gold. Then she took her sash
and tied one end round the butterfly, and the other she
made fast to the leaf which went gliding on quicker and
quicker, and she with it for she was standing on the leaf.</p>

<p>At this moment a big cockchafer came flying along, he
caught sight of her and in an instant he fixed his claw
round her slender waist and flew off with her, up into a
tree, but the green leaf floated down the stream and the
butterfly with it, for he was tied to it and could not get
loose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">(26)</span></p>

<p>Heavens! how frightened poor little Thumbeline was
when the cockchafer carried her up into the tree, but she
was most of all grieved about the pretty white butterfly
which she had fastened to the leaf; if he could not succeed
in getting loose he would be starved to death.</p>

<p>But the cockchafer cared nothing for that. He settled
with her on the largest leaf on the tree, and fed her with
honey from the flowers, and he said that she was lovely
although she was not a bit like a chafer. Presently all
the other chafers which lived in the tree came to visit
them; they looked at Thumbeline and the young lady
chafers twitched their feelers and said, “She has only got
two legs, what a poor effect it has.” “She has no feelers,”
said another. “She is so slender in the waist, fie, she
looks like a human being.” “How ugly she is,” said all
the mother chafers, and yet little Thumbeline was so
pretty. That was certainly also the opinion of the cockchafer
who had captured her, but when all the others said
she was ugly, he at last began to believe it too, and would
not have anything more to do with her, she might go
wherever she liked! They flew down from the tree with
her and placed her on a daisy, where she cried because
she was so ugly that the chafers would have nothing to do
with her; and after all, she was more beautiful than
anything you could imagine, as delicate and transparent
as the finest rose-leaf.</p>

<p>Poor little Thumbeline lived all the summer quite alone
in the wood. She plaited a bed of grass for herself and
hung it up under a big dock-leaf which sheltered her from
the rain; she sucked the honey from the flowers for her
food, and her drink was the dew which lay on the leaves
in the morning. In this way the summer and autumn
passed, but then came the winter. All the birds which
used to sing so sweetly to her flew away, the great dock-leaf
under which she had lived shrivelled up leaving
nothing but a dead yellow stalk, and she shivered with the
cold, for her clothes were worn out; she was such a tiny
creature, poor little Thumbeline, she certainly must be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">(27)</span>
frozen to death. It began to snow
and every snowflake which fell upon
her was like a whole shovelful upon
her, for she was so very, very small.
Then she wrapped herself up in a
withered leaf, but that did not warm
her much, she trembled with the
cold.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp20" id="image027">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/image027.png"><img class="w100" src="images/image027_small.png" alt="" title="Every snowflake which fell upon her was like a shovelful on one of us"></a>
</figure>

<p>Close to the wood in which she
had been living lay a large cornfield,
but the corn had long ago
been carried away and nothing
remained but the bare, dry, stubble
which stood up out of the frozen
ground. The stubble was quite a
forest for her to walk about in;
oh, how she shook with the cold.
Then she came to the door of a
field-mouse’s home. It was a little
hole down under the stubble. The
field-mouse lived so cosily and warm
there, her whole room was full of
corn, and she had a beautiful
kitchen and larder besides. Poor
Thumbeline stood just inside the
door like any other poor beggar
child and begged for a little piece
of barley corn, for she had had
nothing to eat for two whole days.</p>

<p>“You poor little thing,” said
the field-mouse, for she was at
bottom a good old field-mouse. “Come into my warm
room and dine with me.” Then, as she took a fancy
to Thumbeline, she said, “You may with pleasure stay
with me for the winter, but you must keep my room
clean and tidy and tell me stories, for I am very fond of
them,” and Thumbeline did what the good old field-mouse
desired and was on the whole very comfortable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">(28)</span></p>

<p>“Now we shall soon have a visitor,” said the field-mouse;
“my neighbour generally comes to see me every week-day.
He is even better housed than I am; his rooms are very
large and he wears a most beautiful black velvet coat; if
only you could get him for a husband you would indeed
be well settled, but he can’t see. You must tell him all
the most beautiful stories you know.”</p>

<p>But Thumbeline did not like this, and she would have
nothing to say to the neighbour for he was a mole. He
came and paid a visit in his black velvet coat. He was
very rich and wise, said the field-mouse, and his home was
twenty times as large as hers; and he had much learning
but he did not like the sun or the beautiful flowers, in
fact he spoke slightingly of them for he had never seen
them. Thumbeline had to sing to him and she sang both
“Fly away cockchafer” and “A monk, he wandered
through the meadow,” then the mole fell in love with her
because of her sweet voice, but he did not say anything
for he was of a discreet turn of mind.</p>

<p>He had just made a long tunnel through the ground
from his house to theirs, and he gave the field-mouse and
Thumbeline leave to walk in it whenever they liked. He
told them not to be afraid of the dead bird which was
lying in the passage. It was a whole bird with feathers
and beak which had probably died quite recently at the
beginning of the winter and was now entombed just where
he had made his tunnel.</p>

<p>The mole took a piece of tinder-wood in his mouth, for
that shines like fire in the dark, and walked in front of
them to light them in the long dark passage; when they
came to the place where the dead bird lay, the mole thrust
his broad nose up to the roof and pushed the earth up so
as to make a big hole through which the daylight shone.
In the middle of the floor lay a dead swallow, with its
pretty wings closely pressed to its sides, and the legs and
head drawn in under the feathers; no doubt the poor bird
had died of cold. Thumbeline was so sorry for it; she
loved all the little birds, for they had twittered and sung<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">(29)</span>
so sweetly to her during the whole summer; but the mole
kicked it with his short legs and said, “Now it will pipe
no more! It must be a miserable fate to be born a little
bird! Thank heaven! no child of mine can be a bird; a
bird like that has nothing but its twitter and dies of
hunger in the winter.”</p>

<p>“Yes, as a sensible man, you may well say that,” said
the field-mouse. “What <em>has</em> a bird for all its twittering
when the cold weather comes? It has to hunger and freeze,
but then it must cut a dash.”</p>

<p>Thumbeline did not say anything, but when the others
turned their backs to the bird, she stooped down and
stroked aside the feathers which lay over its head, and
kissed its closed eyes. “Perhaps it was this very bird
which sang so sweetly to me in the summer,” she thought;
“what pleasure it gave me, the dear pretty bird.”</p>

<p>The mole now closed up the hole which let in the daylight
and conducted the ladies to their home. Thumbeline
could not sleep at all in the night, so she got up out of
her bed and plaited a large handsome mat of hay and then
she carried it down and spread it all over the dead bird,
and laid some soft cotton wool which she had found in the
field-mouse’s room close round its sides, so that it might
have a warm bed on the cold ground.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, you sweet little bird,” said she, “good-bye,
and thank you for your sweet song through the summer
when all the trees were green and the sun shone warmly
upon us.” Then she laid her head close up to the bird’s
breast, but was quite startled at a sound, as if something
was thumping inside it. It was the bird’s heart. It was
not dead but lay in a swoon, and now that it had been
warmed it began to revive.</p>

<p>In the autumn all the swallows fly away to warm
countries, but if one happens to be belated, it feels the
cold so much that it falls down like a dead thing,
and remains lying where it falls till the snow covers
it up. Thumbeline quite shook with fright for the
bird was very, very big beside her, but she gathered up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">(30)</span>
her courage, packed the wool closer round the poor
bird, and fetched a leaf of mint which she had herself
for a coverlet and laid it over the bird’s head.
The next night she stole down again
to it and found it alive but so feeble that
it could only just open its eyes for a
moment to look at Thumbeline who
stood with a bit of tinder-wood in her
hand, for she had no other lantern.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp40" id="image030">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/image030.png"><img class="w100" src="images/image030_small.png" alt="" title="It was not dead but lay in a swoon"></a>
</figure>

<p>“Many, many thanks, you sweet child,”
said the sick swallow to her; “you
have warmed me beautifully. I shall soon have strength
to fly out into the warm sun again.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said she, “it is so cold outside, it snows and
freezes, stay in your warm bed, I will tend you.” Then
she brought water to the swallow in a leaf, and when it
had drunk some, it told her how it had torn its wing on
a blackthorn bush, and therefore could not fly as fast as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">(31)</span>
the other swallows which were taking flight then for the
distant warm lands. At last it fell down on the ground,
but after that it remembered nothing and did not in the
least know how it had got into the tunnel.</p>

<p>It stayed there all the winter, and Thumbeline was
good to it and grew very fond of it. She did not tell
either the mole or the field-mouse anything about it, for
they did not like the poor unfortunate swallow.</p>

<p>As soon as the spring came and the warmth of the sun
penetrated the ground, the swallow said good-bye to
Thumbeline, who opened the hole which the mole had
made above. The sun streamed in deliciously upon them,
and the swallow asked if she would not go with him, she
could sit upon his back and they would fly far away into
the green wood. But Thumbeline knew that it would
grieve the old field-mouse if she left her like that.</p>

<p>“No, I can’t,” said Thumbeline.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, good-bye, then, you kind pretty girl,” said
the swallow, and flew out into the sunshine. Thumbeline
looked after him and her eyes filled with tears, for she was
very fond of the poor swallow.</p>

<p>“Tweet, tweet,” sang the bird, and flew into the green
wood.</p>

<p>Thumbeline was very sad. She was not allowed to go
out into the warm sunshine at all; the corn which was
sown in the field near the field-mouse’s house grew quite
long, it was a thick forest for the poor little girl who was
so very, very small.</p>

<p>“You must work at your trousseau this summer,” said
the mouse to her, for their neighbour the tiresome mole in
his black velvet coat had asked her to marry him. “You
shall have both woollen and linen, you shall have wherewith
to clothe and cover yourself when you become the
mole’s wife.” Thumbeline had to turn the distaff and the
field-mouse hired four spiders to spin and weave day and
night. The mole paid a visit every evening and he was
always saying that when the summer came to an end, the
sun would not shine nearly so warmly; now it burnt the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">(32)</span>
ground as hard as a stone. Yes, when the summer was
over he would celebrate his marriage; but Thumbeline was
not at all pleased, for she did not care a bit for the tiresome
mole. Every morning at sunrise and every evening
at sunset she used to steal out to the door, and when the
wind blew aside the tops of the cornstalks so that she
could see the blue sky, she thought how bright and lovely
it was out there, and wished so much to see the dear
swallow again; but it never came back; no doubt it was a
long way off, flying about in the beautiful green woods.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp40" id="image032">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/image032.png"><img class="w100" src="images/image032_small.png" alt="" title="Fiddle-de-dee said the field mouse"></a>
</figure>

<p>When the autumn came all Thumbeline’s outfit was ready.</p>

<p>“In four weeks you must be married,” said the field-mouse
to her. But Thumbeline cried and said that she
would not have the tiresome mole for a husband.</p>

<p>“Fiddle-dee-dee,” said the field-mouse; “don’t be obstinate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">(33)</span>
or I shall bite you with my white tooth. You
are going to have a splendid husband; the queen herself
hasn’t the equal of his black velvet coat; both his
kitchen and his cellar are full. You should thank
heaven for such a husband!”</p>

<p>So they were to be married; the mole had come to
fetch Thumbeline; she was to live deep down under the
ground with him, and never to go out into the warm sunshine,
for he could not bear it. The poor child was very
sad at the thought of bidding good-bye to the beautiful
sun; while she had been with the field-mouse she had
at least been allowed to look at it from the door.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, you bright sun,” she said as she stretched
out her arms towards it and went a little way outside
the field-mouse’s house, for now the harvest was over
and only the stubble remained. “Good-bye, good-bye!”
she said, and threw her tiny arms round a little red flower
growing there. “Give my love to the dear swallow if you
happen to see him.”</p>

<p>“Tweet, tweet,” she heard at this moment above her
head. She looked up; it was the swallow just passing.
As soon as it saw Thumbeline it was delighted; she told
it how unwilling she was to have the ugly mole for a
husband, and that she was to live deep down underground
where the sun never shone. She could not
help crying about it.</p>

<p>“The cold winter is coming,” said the swallow, <span id="cor33">“</span>and I
am going to fly away to warm countries. Will you go with
me? You can sit upon my back! Tie yourself on with
your sash, then we will fly away from the ugly mole and his
dark cavern, far away over the mountains to those warm
countries where the sun shines with greater splendour
than here, where it is always summer and there are
heaps of flowers. Do fly with me, you sweet little
Thumbeline, who saved my life when I lay frozen in
the dark earthy passage.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will go with you,” said Thumbeline, seating
herself on the bird’s back with her feet on its outspread<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">(34)</span>
wings. She tied her band tightly to one of the strongest
feathers, and then the swallow flew away, high up in the
air above forests and lakes, high up above the biggest
mountains where the snow never melts; and Thumbeline
shivered in the cold air, but then she crept under the
bird’s warm feathers, and only stuck out her little head
to look at the beautiful sights beneath her.</p>

<p>Then at last they reached the warm countries. The
sun shone with a warmer glow than here; the sky was
twice as high, and the most beautiful green and blue
grapes grew in clusters on the banks and hedgerows.
Oranges and lemons hung in the woods which were
fragrant with myrtles and sweet herbs, and beautiful
children ran about the roads playing with the large,
gorgeously-coloured butterflies. But the swallow flew
on and on, and the country grew more and more
beautiful. Under magnificent green trees on the shores
of the blue sea stood a dazzling white marble palace of
ancient date; vines wreathed themselves round the stately
pillars. At the head of these there were countless nests,
and the swallow who carried Thumbeline lived in one of them.</p>

<p>“Here is my house,” said the swallow; “but if you
will choose one of the gorgeous flowers growing down
there I will place you in it, and you will live as happily
as you can wish.”</p>

<p>“That would be delightful,” she said, and clapped her
little hands.</p>

<p>A great white marble column had fallen to the ground
and lay there broken in three pieces, but between these
the most lovely white flowers grew. The swallow flew
down with Thumbeline and put her upon one of the broad
leaves; what was her astonishment to find a little man in
the middle of the flower, as bright and transparent as if
he had been made of glass. He had a lovely golden crown
upon his head and the most beautiful bright wings upon
his shoulders; he was no bigger than Thumbeline. He
was the fairy of the flowers. There was a similar little man
or woman in every flower, but he was the king of them all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">(35)</span></p>

<p>“How very beautiful he is,” whispered Thumbeline
to the swallow. The little prince was quite frightened by
the swallow, for it was a perfect giant of a bird to him,
he who was so small and delicate, but when he saw
Thumbeline he was delighted; she was the very prettiest
girl he had ever seen. He therefore took the golden
crown off his own head and placed it on hers, and asked
her name, and if she would be his wife, and then she
would be queen of the flowers! Yes, he was certainly a
very different kind of husband from the toad’s son, or the
mole with his black velvet coat. So she accepted the
beautiful prince, and out of every flower stepped a little
lady or a gentleman so lovely that it was a pleasure to
look at them. Each one brought a gift to Thumbeline,
but the best of all was a pair of pretty wings from a large
white butterfly; they were fastened on to her back, and
then she too could fly from flower to flower. All was then
delight and happiness, but the swallow sat alone in his
nest and sang to them as well as he could, for his heart was
heavy, he was so fond of Thumbeline
himself and would have wished
never to part from her.</p>

  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/image035.png"><img class="w100" src="images/image035_small.png" alt="" title="What was her astonishment to find a little man in the middle of the flower"></a>
</figure>

<p>“You shall not be called Thumbeline,”
said the flower-fairy to her;
“that is such an ugly name, and
you are so pretty. We will call
you Maia.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Of course the Fairy Prince’s
story was quite true, and as proof of it there was
Thumbeline, or Maia, as she was sometimes called,
sitting not very far away in the very front circle of
fairies, and having made his bow to the king and
queen, the little prince stepped proudly back to
his seat by her side, and all the fairies loudly
cheered the pretty couple. When the cheering had stopped
it was seen that there were several of the company trying to
get on the tale-tellers’ stool at once, all anxious to win such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">(36)</span>
cheering. King Oberon’s trumpeter, standing on the steps of
the throne, blew loudly and the squabble stopped at once,
each of the competitors turning round and expecting to be
told that he was the favoured one, but Oberon was too
wise for that and bade them all go back to their places
and not to come forward again until called upon to do so,
and he then turned to Titania and said:</p>

<p>“Our queen shall select the next tale-teller. Who, my
Titania, shall it be?”</p>

<p>And the queen pointed out a little fairy dressed all in
green with a tiny golden harp in her hand and with a wreath
of shamrock round her head, saying:</p>

<p>“Let an Irish fairy tell us something of the doings in
her green land.”</p>

<p>The little one in green at once came forward and said
that the story she had to tell would not be a pretty one
such as that about Thumbeline, but it would be about one of
those mischievous changelings who got the fairies such a
bad name among some people, and her story would be
called</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="the_young_piper">The Young Piper</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent">There lived on the borders of the county of Tipperary
a decently honest couple whose names were Mick Flanigan
and Judy Muldoon. These poor people were blessed, as
the saying is, with four children, all boys: three of them
were as fine, stout, healthy, good-looking children as ever
the sun shone upon; and it was enough to make any Irishman
proud of his countrymen to see them about one o’clock
on a fine summer day standing at their father’s cabin door,
with their beautiful flaxen hair hanging in curls about their
heads, and their cheeks like two rosy apples, and a big
laughing potato smoking in their hands. A proud man was
Mick of these fine children, and a proud woman, too, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">(38)</span>
Judy; and reason enough they had to be so. But it was
far otherwise with the remaining one, which was the third
eldest: he was the most miserable, ugly, ill-conditioned
brat you ever saw: he was so ill-thriven that he never was
able to stand alone, or to leave the cradle; he had long,
shaggy, matted, curled hair, as black as the soot; his face
was of a greenish-yellow colour; his eyes were like two
burning coals, and were for ever moving in his head, as if
they had had the perpetual motion. Before he was a
twelvemonth old he had a mouthful of great teeth; his
hands were like kite’s claws, and his legs were no thicker
than the handle of a whip, and about as straight as a
reaping hook: to make the matter worse, he had the
appetite of a cormorant, and the whinge, and the yelp,
and the screech, and the yowl was never out of his
mouth.</p>

<p>The neighbours all suspected that he was something not
right, particularly as it was observed, when people, as they
do in the country, got about the fire and began to talk of
religion and good things, the brat, as he lay in the cradle,
which his mother generally put near the <span id="cor38">fire-place</span> that he
might be snug, used to sit up, as they were in the middle
of their talk, and begin to bellow as if the devil was in him
in right earnest: this, as I said, led the neighbours to think
that all was not right, and there was a general consultation
held one day about what would be best to do with him.
Some advised one thing, and some another; at last one
spoke of sending for the priest, who was a very holy and
a very learned man, to see it. To this Judy of course had
no objection, but one thing or another always prevented
her doing so, and the upshot of the business was that the
priest never saw him.</p>

<p>Things went on in the old way for some time longer.
The brat continued yelping and yowling, and eating more
than his three brothers put together, and playing all
sorts of unlucky tricks, for he was mighty mischievously
inclined; till it happened one day that Tim Carrol, the
blind piper, going his rounds, called in and sat down by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">(39)</span>
the fire to have a bit of chat with the woman of the house.
So after some time, Tim, who was no churl of his music,
yoked on the pipes, and began to bellows away in high
style; when the instant he began, the young fellow, who
had been lying as still as a mouse in his cradle, sat up,
began to grin and twist his ugly face, to swing about his
long tawny arms, and to kick out his crooked legs, and to
show signs of great glee at the music. At last nothing
would serve him but he should get the pipes into his own
hands, and to humour him his mother asked Tim to lend
them to the child for a minute. Tim, who was kind to
children, readily consented; and as Tim had not his sight,
Judy herself brought them to the cradle, and went to put
them on him; but she had no occasion, for the youth
seemed quite up to the business. He buckled on the
pipes, set the bellows under one arm, and the bag under
the other, worked them both as knowingly as if he had
been twenty years at the business, and lilted up “Sheela
na guira” in the finest style imaginable.</p>

<p>All were in astonishment: the poor woman crossed
herself. Tim, who, as I said before, was dark, and did
not well know who was playing, was in great delight; and
when he heard that it was a little prechan not five years
old, that had never seen a set of pipes in his life, he wished
the mother joy of her son; offered to take him off her hands
if she would part with him, swore he was born a piper, a
natural <em>genus</em>, and declared that in a little time more, with
the help of a little good instruction from himself, there
would not be his match in the whole county. The poor
woman was greatly delighted to hear all this, particularly as
what Tim said about natural genus quieted some misgivings
that were rising in her mind, lest what the neighbours said
about his not being right might be too true; and it gratified
her moreover to think that her dear child (for she really
loved the whelp) would not be forced to turn out and beg,
but might earn decent bread for himself. So when Mick
came home in the evening from his work, she up and told
him all that had happened, and all that Tim Carrol had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">(40)</span>
said; and Mick, as was natural, was very glad to hear
it, for the helpless condition of the poor creature was a
great trouble to him. So next day he took the pig to
the fair, and with what it brought set off to Clonmel,
and bespoke a <span id="cor40">brand-new</span> set of pipes of the proper size
for him.</p>

<p>In about a fortnight the pipes came home, and the
moment the chap in his cradle laid eyes on them, he
squealed with delight and threw up his legs, and bumped
himself in his cradle, and went on with a great many
comical tricks; till at last, to quiet him, they gave him
the pipes, and he immediately set to and pulled away
at “Jig Polthog,” to the admiration of all that heard
him.</p>

<p>The fame of his skill on the pipes soon spread far and
near, for there was not a piper in the next six counties
could come at all near him in “Old Moderagh rue,” or
“The Hare in the Corn,” or “The Fox-Hunter’s Jig,” or
“The Rakes of Cashel,” or “The Piper’s Maggot,” or
any of the fine Irish jigs which make people dance
whether they will or no: and it was surprising to hear
him rattle away “The Fox Hunt”; you’d really think
you heard the hounds giving tongue and the terriers
yelping always behind, and the huntsman and the
whippers-in cheering or correcting the dogs; it was, in
short, the very next thing to seeing the hunt itself.</p>

<p>The best of him was he was noways stingy of his
music, and many a merry dance the boys and girls of
the neighbourhood used to have in his father’s cabin;
and he would play up music for them, that they said
used as it were to put quicksilver in their feet; and
they all declared they never moved so light and so airy
to any piper’s playing that ever they danced to.</p>

<p>But besides all his fine Irish music, he had one queer
tune of his own, the oddest that ever was heard; for the
moment he began to play it everything in the house seemed
disposed to dance; the plates and porringers used to jingle
on the dresser, the pots and pot-hooks used to rattle in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">(41)</span>
chimney, and people used even to fancy they felt the stools
moving from under them; but, however it might be with
the stools, it is certain that no one could keep long sitting
on them, for both old and young always fell to capering
as hard as ever they could. The girls complained that
when he began this tune it always threw them out in their
dancing, and that they never could handle their feet rightly,
for they felt the floor like ice under them, and themselves
every moment ready to come sprawling on their backs or
their faces. The young bachelors that wished to show off
their dancing and their new pumps, and their bright red or
green and yellow garters, swore that it confused them so
that they never could go rightly through the <i>heel and toe</i>,
or <i>cover the buckle</i>, or any of their best steps, but felt
themselves always all bedizzied and bewildered, and then
old and young would go jostling and knocking together
in a frightful manner; and when the unlucky brat had
them all in this way, whirligigging about the floor, he’d
grin and chuckle and chatter, for all the world like
Jacko the monkey when he has played off some of his
roguery.</p>

<p>The older he grew the worse he grew, and by the time
he was six years old there was no standing the house for
him; he was always making his brothers burn or scald
themselves, or break their shins over the pots and stools.
One time, in harvest, he was left at home by himself, and
when his mother came in she found the cat a-horseback
on the dog, with her face to the tail, and her legs tied
round him, and the urchin playing his queer tune to
them; so that the dog went barking and jumping about,
and puss was mewing for the dear life, and slapping her
tail backwards and forwards, which, as it would hit against
the dog’s chaps, he’d snap it and bite, and then there
was the philliloo. Another time, the farmer with whom
Mick worked, a very decent, respectable man, happened
to call in, and Judy wiped a stool with her apron, and
invited him to sit down and rest himself after his walk.
He was sitting with his back to the cradle, and behind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">(42)</span>
him was a pan of blood, for Judy was making pig’s
puddings. The lad lay quite still in his nest, and watched
his opportunity till he got ready a hook at the end of a
piece of twine, which he contrived to fling so handily that
it caught in the bob of the man’s nice new wig, and soused
it in the pan of blood. Another time his mother was
coming in from milking the cow, with the pail on her
head: the minute he saw her he lilted up his infernal
tune and the poor woman, letting go the pail, clapped her
hands aside and began to dance a jig, and tumbled the
milk all atop of her husband, who was bringing in some
turf to boil the supper. In short there would be no end
to telling all his pranks, and all the mischievous tricks he
played.</p>

<p>Soon after, some mischances began to happen to the
farmer’s cattle. A horse took the staggers, a fine veal
calf died, and some of his sheep; the cows began to
grow vicious, and to kick down the milk pails, and
the roof of one end of the barn fell in; and the farmer
took it into his head that Mick Flanigan’s unlucky
child was the cause of all the mischief. So one day
he called Mick aside and said to him: “Mick, you see
things are not going on with me as they ought, and to be
plain with you, Mick, I think that child of yours is the
cause of it. I am really falling away to nothing with
fretting, and I can hardly sleep on my bed at night for
thinking of what may happen before the morning. So I’d
be glad if you’d look out for work somewhere else; you’re
as good a man as any in the country, and there’s no fear
but you’ll have your choice of work.”</p>

<p>To this Mick replied, that he was sorry for his losses,
and still sorrier that he and his should be thought to be the
cause of them; that for his own part he was not quite
easy in his mind about that child, but he had him and so
must keep him. And he promised to look out for another
place at once.</p>

<p>So Mick gave out that he was about to leave his work
at John Riordan’s, and immediately a farmer who lived a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">(43)</span>
couple of miles off, and who wanted a ploughman (the
last one having just left him), came up to Mick, and
offered him a house and garden, and work all the year
round. Mick, who knew him to be a good employer,
immediately closed with him; so it was agreed the farmer
should send a car to take his little bit of furniture, and that
he should remove on the following Thursday.</p>

<p>When Thursday came, the car came according to
promise, and Mick loaded it, and put the cradle with the
child and his pipes on the top, and Judy sat beside it to
take care of him, lest he should tumble out. They drove
the cow before them, the dog followed, but the cat was of
course left behind; and the other three children went
along the road picking skee-hories (haws) and blackberries,
for it was a fine day towards the latter end of
harvest.</p>

<p>They had to cross a river, but as it ran through a
bottom between two high banks, you did not see it till
you were close on it. The young fellow was lying pretty
quiet in the bottom of the cradle, till they came to the
head of the bridge, when hearing the roaring of the water
(for there was a great flood in the river, as it had rained
heavily for the last two or three days), he sat up in his
cradle and looked about him; and the instant he got a
sight of the water and found they were going to take him
across it, oh! how he did bellow and how he did squeal!—no
rat caught in a snap-trap ever sang out equal to
him.</p>

<p>“Whisht! a lanna,” said Judy, “there’s no fear of you;
sure it’s only over the stone bridge we’re going.”</p>

<p>“Bad luck to you, you old rip!” cried he, “what a
pretty trick you’ve played me, to bring me here!” And still
he went on yelling, and the further they got on the bridge
the louder he yelled, till at last Mick could hold out no
longer, so giving him a skelp with the whip he had in his
hand, “You brat!” he said, “will you never stop bawling?
A body can’t hear their ears for you.”</p>

<p>The moment he felt the thong of the whip, he leaped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">(44)</span>
up in the cradle, clapped the pipes under his arm, gave a
most wicked grin at Mick, and jumped clean off the cart
over the side of the bridge down into the water.</p>

<p>“O my child, my child!” shouted Judy, “he’s gone
for ever from me.”</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp20" id="image044">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/image044.png"><img class="w100" src="images/image044_small.png" alt="" title="Sitting cross-legged on the top of a wave"></a>
</figure>

<p>Mick and the rest of the children ran to the other side
of the bridge, and looking over,
they saw him coming out from
under the arch of the bridge,
sitting cross-legged on the top
of a white-headed wave,
and playing away on the
pipes as merrily <span id="cor44">as</span> if
nothing had happened.
The river
was running very
rapidly, so he was whirled away at a great rate; but he
played as fast, ay and faster, than the river ran; and
though they set off as hard as they could along the bank,
yet, as the river made a sudden turn round the hill,
about a hundred yards below the bridge, by the time they
got there he was out of sight, and no one ever laid eyes
on him more; but the general opinion was that he went
home with the pipes to his own relations, the good people,
to make music for them.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“They must have been well-rid of such an uncomfortable
child,” said King Oberon, though it was noticed that
he and most of the fairies were laughing to think of the
astonishment which must have been shown by Mick and
Judy when the young piper went plump over into the
river off the cart-load of furniture.</p>

<p>They were still laughing when a voice exclaimed,</p>

<p>“Mine is a short story with a long name.”</p>

</div>

<p>At once the laughter stopped and all turned to the stool
on which a quaint Gnome was sitting with one leg over
the knee of the other and with his hands clasping his foot
was rocking backwards and forwards until he saw that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">(47)</span>
everybody’s attention was directed to him, when he went

<h2 class="nobreak" id="rumpel_stilts_ken">Rumpel-Stilts-Ken</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent">By the side of a wood, in a
country a long way off, ran a fine
stream of water; and upon the
stream there stood a mill. The
miller’s house was close by, and
the miller, you must know, had a
very beautiful daughter. She was,
moreover, very shrewd and clever;
and the miller was so proud of
her, that he one day told the king
of the land, who used to come
and hunt in the wood, that his
daughter could spin gold out of
straw. Now this king was very
fond of money; and when he
heard the miller’s boast his greediness
was raised, and he sent for
the girl to be brought before him. Then he led her to a
chamber in his palace where there was a great heap of
straw, and gave her a spinning-wheel, and said, “All this
must be spun into gold before morning, as you love your
life.” It was in vain that the poor maiden said that it was
only a silly boast of her father, for that she could do no
such thing as spin straw into gold: the chamber door
was locked, and she was left alone.</p>

<p>She sat down in one corner of the room, and began
to bewail her hard fate; when on a sudden the door
opened, and a droll-looking little man hobbled in, and
said, “Good morrow to you, my good lass; what are
you weeping for?” “Alas!” said she, “I must spin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">(49)</span>
this straw into gold, and I know not how.” “What
will you give me,” said the hobgoblin, “to do it for
you?” “My necklace,” replied the maiden. He took
her at her word, and sat himself down to the wheel, and
whistled and sang—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Round about, round about,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Lo and behold!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Reel away, reel away,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Straw into gold!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And round about the wheel went merrily; the work was
quickly done, and the straw was all spun into gold.</p>

<p>When the king came in and saw this, he was greatly
astonished and pleased; but his heart grew still more
greedy of gain, and he shut up the poor miller’s daughter
again with a fresh task. Then she knew not what to
do, and sat down once more to weep; but the dwarf
soon opened the door, and said, “What will you give
me to do your task?” “The ring on my finger,” said
she. So her little friend took the ring, and began to
work at the wheel again, and whistled and sang—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indentq">“Round about, round about,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Reel away, reel away,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Straw into gold!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">till, long before morning, all was done again.</p>

<p>The king was greatly delighted to see all this glittering
treasure; but still he had not enough: so he took
the miller’s daughter to a yet larger heap, and said,
“All this must be spun to-night; and if it is, you
shall be my queen.” As soon as she was alone the
dwarf came in, and said, “What will you give me to
spin gold for you this third time?” “I have nothing
left,” said she. “Then say you will give me,” said the
little man, “the first little child that you may have when
you are queen.” “That may never be,” thought the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">(50)</span>
miller’s daughter: and as she knew no other way to
get her task done, she said she would do what he
asked. Round went the wheel again to the old song,
and the manikin once more spun the heap into gold.
The king came in the morning, and, finding all he
wanted, was forced to keep his word; so he married
the miller’s daughter, and she really became queen.</p>

<p>At the birth of her first little child she was very glad,
and forgot the dwarf, and what she had said. But one
day he came into her room, where she was sitting playing
with her baby, and put her in mind of it. Then
she grieved sorely at her misfortune, and said she would
give him all the wealth of the kingdom if he would let her
off, but in vain; till at last her tears softened him, and
he said, “I will give you three days’ grace, and, if during
that time you tell me my name, you shall keep your
child.”</p>

<p>Now the queen lay awake all night, thinking of all
the odd names that she had ever heard; and she sent
messengers all over the land to find out new ones. The
next day the little man came, and she began with
<span class="smcap">Timothy</span>, <span class="smcap">Ichabod</span>, <span class="smcap">Benjamin</span>, <span class="smcap">Jeremiah</span>, and all the
names she could remember; but to all and each of
them he said, “Madam, that is not my name.”</p>

<p>The second day she began with all the comical names
she could hear of, <span class="smcap">Bandy-legs</span>, <span class="smcap">Hunch-back</span>, <span class="smcap">Crook-shanks</span>,
and so on; but the little gentleman still said to
every one of them, “Madam, that is not my name.”</p>

<p>The third day one of the messengers came back and
said, “I travelled two days without hearing of any other
names; but yesterday, as I was climbing a high hill,
among the trees of the forest where the fox and the
hare bid each other good-night, I saw a little hut; and
before the hut burnt a fire; and round about the fire a
funny little dwarf was dancing upon one leg, and singing—</p>

</figure>

<p>When the queen heard this she jumped for joy, and as
soon as her little friend came she sat down upon her
throne, and called all her court
round to enjoy the fun; and the
nurse stood by her side with the
baby in her arms, as if it was quite
ready to be given up. Then the
little man began to chuckle at the
thoughts of having the poor child
to take home with
him to his hut in the
woods; and he cried
out, “Now, lady, what
is my name?” “Is
it <span class="smcap">John</span>?” asked she.
“No, madam!” “Is it <span class="smcap">Tom</span>?” “No, madam!”
“Is it <span class="smcap">Jemmy</span>?” “It is not<span id="cor53a">!</span>” “Can your name be
<span class="smcap">Rumpel-stilts-ken</span>?” said the lady slily. “Some witch
told you that!—some witch told you that!” cried the little
man, and dashed his right foot in a rage so deep into the
floor, that he was forced to lay hold of it with both hands
to pull it out.</p>

<p>Then he made the best of his way off, while the nurse
laughed and the baby crowed; and all the court jeered
at him for having had so much trouble for nothing, and
said, “We wish you a very good morning, and a merry
feast, Mr <span class="smcap">Rumpel-stilts-ken</span>!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“Too short, too short,” said King Oberon.</p>

<p>“Your Majesty,” protested the Gnome in a dignified
manner, “a story should not be measured by the number
of words which it contains, nor should twenty minutes be
spent over a tale which can be told in ten.<span id="cor53b">”</span></p>

<p>“True,” replied Oberon good-humouredly, “but as you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">(54)</span>
can tell us so much in so little time perhaps you can tell

merely pausing while he reversed the position of his legs
so that he nursed the left one instead of the right, he began
the story of</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="karl_katz">Karl Katz</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent">In the midst of the Hartz forests there is a high mountain,
of which the neighbours tell all sorts of stories: how the
goblins and fairies dance on it by night; and how the old
Emperor Red-beard holds his court there, and sits on
his marble throne, with his long beard sweeping on the
ground.</p>

<p>A great many years ago there lived in a village at the
foot of this mountain, one Karl Katz. Now Karl was a
goatherd, and every morning he drove his flock to feed
upon the green spots that are here and there found on
the mountain’s side. In the evening he sometimes thought
it too late to drive his charge home; so he used in such
cases to shut it up in a spot amongst the woods, where
the old ruined walls of some castle that had long ago been
deserted were left standing, and were high enough to form<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">(56)</span>
a fold, in which he could count his goats, and let them rest
for the night. One evening he found that the prettiest
goat of his flock had vanished, soon after they were
driven into this fold. He searched everywhere for it
in vain; but, to his surprise and delight, when he
counted his flock in the morning, what should he see,
the first of the flock, but his lost goat! Again and again
the same strange thing happened. At last he thought
he would watch still more narrowly; and, having looked
carefully over the old walls, he found a narrow doorway,
through which it seemed that his favourite made her
way. Karl followed, and found a path leading downwards
through a cleft in the rocks. On he went, scrambling
as well as he could, down the side of the rock, and at
last came to the mouth of a cave, where he lost sight
of his goat. Just then he saw that his faithful dog was
not with him. He whistled, but no dog was there; and
he was therefore forced to go into the cave and try to
find his goat by himself.</p>

<p>He groped his way for a while, and at last came to
a place where a little light found its way in; and there
he wondered not a little to find his goat, employing itself
very much at its ease in the cavern, in eating corn, which
kept dropping from some place over its head. He went
up and looked about him, to see where all this corn, that
rattled about his ears like a hail-storm, could come from:
but all overhead was dark, and he could find no clue to
this strange business.</p>

<p>At last, as he stood listening, he thought he heard the
neighing and stamping of horses. He listened again; it
was plainly so; and after a while he was sure that horses
were feeding above him, and that the corn fell from their
mangers. What could these horses be which were thus
kept in the clefts of rocks, where none but the goat’s foot
ever trod? There must be people of some sort or other
living here; and who could they be? and was it safe to
trust himself in such company? Karl pondered awhile;
but his wonder only grew greater and greater, when on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">(57)</span>
sudden he heard his own name, “Karl Katz!” echo through
the cavern. He turned round, but could see nothing.
“Karl Katz!” again sounded sharply in his ears; and
soon out came a little dwarfish page, with a high-peaked
hat and a scarlet cloak, from a dark corner at one
end of the cave.</p>

<p>The dwarf nodded, and beckoned him to follow. Karl
thought he should first like to know a little about who it
was that thus sought his company. He asked: but the
dwarf shook his head, answering not a word, and again
beckoned him to follow. He did so; and winding his
way through ruins, he soon heard rolling overhead
what sounded like peals of thunder, echoing among
the rocks: the noise grew louder and louder as he
went on, and at last he came to a courtyard surrounded
by old ivy-grown walls. The spot seemed to be the
bosom of a little valley; above rose on every hand
high masses of rock; wide-branching trees threw their
arms overhead, so that nothing but a glimmering twilight
made its way through; and here, on the cool smooth-shaven
turf, Karl saw twelve strange old figures amusing
themselves very sedately with a game of nine-pins.</p>

<p>Their dress did not seem altogether strange to Karl,
for in the church of the town whither he went every
week to market there was an old monument, with figures
of queer old knights upon it, dressed in the very same
fashion. Not a word fell from any of their lips. They
moved about soberly and gravely, each taking his turn
at the game; but the oldest of them ordered Karl Katz,
by dumb signs, to busy himself in setting up the pins as
they knocked them down. At first his knees trembled,
as he hardly dared snatch a stolen sidelong glance at
the long beards and old-fashioned dresses of the worthy
knights; but he soon saw that as each knight played out
his game he went to his seat, and there took a hearty
draught at a flagon, which the dwarf kept filled, and
which sent up the smell of the richest old wine.</p>

<p>Little by little Karl got bolder; and at last he plucked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">(58)</span>
up his heart so far as to beg the dwarf, by signs, to let
him too take his turn at the flagon. The dwarf gave it
him with a grave bow, and Karl thought he never tasted
anything half so good before. This gave him new strength
for his work; and as often as he flagged at all he turned
to the same kind friend for help in his need.</p>

<p>Which was tired first, he or the knights, Karl never
could tell; or whether the wine got the better of his
head: but what he knew was, that sleep at last overpowered
him, and that when he awoke he found himself
stretched out upon the old spot within the walls where
he had folded his flock, and saw that the bright sun was
high up in the heavens. The same green turf was spread
beneath, and the same tottering ivy-clad walls surrounded
him. He rubbed his eyes and called his dog; but neither
dog nor goat was to be seen; and when he looked about
him again, the grass seemed to be longer under his feet
than it was yesterday; and trees hung over his head
which he had either never seen before, or had quite forgotten.
Shaking his head, and hardly knowing whether
he was in his right mind, he got up and stretched himself:
somehow or other his joints felt stiffer than they were.
“It serves me right,” said he; “this comes of sleeping
out of one’s own bed.” Little by little he recollected
his evening’s sport, and licked his lips as he thought of
the charming wine he had taken so much of. “But who,”
thought he, “can those people be, that come to this odd
place to play at nine-pins?”</p>

<p>His first step was to look for the doorway through
which he had followed his goat; but to his astonishment,
not the least trace of an opening of any sort was to be
seen. There stood the wall, without chink or crack big
enough for a rat to pass through. Again he paused
and scratched his head. His hat was full of holes:
“Why, it was new last Shrove-tide!” said he. By chance
his eye fell next on his shoes, which were almost new
when he last left home; but now they looked so old,
that they were likely to fall to pieces before he could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">(61)</span>
get home. All his clothes seemed in the same sad plight.
The more he looked, the more he pondered, the more he
was at a loss to know what could have happened to
him.</p>

</figure>
</div>

<p>At length he turned round, and left the old walls to
look for his flock. Slow and out of heart he wound his
way among the mountain steeps, through paths where
his flocks were wont to wander: still not a goat was to
be seen. Again he whistled and called his dog, but no
dog came. Below him in the plain lay the village where
his home was; so at length he took the downward path,
and set out with a heavy heart and a faltering step in
search of his flock.</p>

<p>“Surely,” said he, “I shall soon meet some neighbour,
who can tell me where my goats are?” But the people
who met him, as he drew near to the village, were all
unknown to him. They were not even dressed as his
neighbours were, and they seemed as if they hardly spoke
the same tongue. When he eagerly asked each, as he
came up, after his goats, they only stared at him and
stroked their chins. At last he did the same too; and
what was his wonder to find that his beard was grown
at least a foot long! “The world,” said he to himself,
“is surely turned upside down, or if not, I must be
bewitched”: and yet he knew the mountain, as he turned
round again, and looked back on its woody heights; and
he knew the houses and cottages also, with their little
gardens, as he entered the village. All were in the
places he had always known them in; and he heard some
children, too (as a traveller that passed by was asking his
way), call the village by the very same name he had
always known it to bear.</p>

<p>Again he shook his head, and went straight through
the village to his own cottage. Alas! it looked sadly
out of repair; the windows were broken, the door off its
hinges, and in the courtyard lay an unknown child, in a
ragged dress, playing with a rough, toothless old dog,
whom he thought he ought to know, but who snarled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">(62)</span>
and barked in his face when he called to him. He went
in at the open doorway; but he found all so dreary and
empty, that he staggered out again like a drunken
man, and called his wife and children loudly by their
names: but no one heard, at least no one answered
him.</p>

<p>A crowd of women and children soon flocked around
the strange-looking man with the long grey beard; and
all broke upon him at once with the questions, “Who
are you?” “Who is it that you want?” It seemed
to him so odd to ask other people, at his own door,
after his wife and children, that, in order to get rid of
the crowd, he named the first man that came into his
head. “Hans the blacksmith?” said he. Most held
their tongues and stared; but at last an old woman said,
“He went these seven years ago to a place that you
will not reach to-day.” “Fritz the tailor, then?”
“Heaven rest his soul!” said an old beldam upon
crutches; “he has lain these ten years in a house that
he’ll never leave.”</p>

<p>Karl Katz looked at the old woman again, and shuddered,
as he knew her to be one of his old gossips; but saw
she had a strangely altered face. All wish to ask further
questions was gone; but at last a young woman made her
way through the gaping throng, with a baby in her arms,
and a little girl of about three years old clinging to her other
hand. All three looked the very image of his own wife.
“What is thy name?” asked he, wildly. “Liese!” said
she. “And your father’s?” “Karl Katz! Heaven bless
him!” said she: “but, poor man! he is lost and gone.
It is now full twenty years since we sought for him day and
night on the mountain. His dog and his flock came back,
but he never was heard of any more. I was then seven
years old.”</p>

<p>Poor Karl could hold no longer: “I am Karl Katz,
and no other!” said he, as he took the child from his
daughter’s arms and kissed it over and over again.</p>

<p>All stood gaping, and hardly knowing what to say or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">(63)</span>
think, when old Stropken the schoolmaster hobbled by,
and took a long and close look at him. “Karl Katz! Karl
Katz!” said he slowly: “why, it <em>is</em> Karl Katz, sure
enough! There is my own mark upon
him; there is the scar over his right
eye, that I gave him myself one day
with my oak stick.” Then several
others also cried out, “Yes it is! it
is Karl Katz! Welcome, neighbour,
welcome home!” “But where,” said
or thought all, “can an honest steady
fellow like you have been these twenty
years?”</p>

<figure class="figright illowp10" id="image063">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/image063.png"><img class="w100" src="images/image063_small.png" alt="" title="The strange-looking man with the long grey beard"></a>
</figure>

<p>And now the whole village had
flocked around; the children laughed,
the dogs barked, and all were glad
to see neighbour Karl home alive and
well. As to where he had been for
the twenty years, that was a part of the story at which
Karl shrugged up his shoulders; for he never could very
well explain it, and seemed to think the less that was
said about it the better. But it was plain enough that
what dwelt most on his memory was the noble wine that
had tickled his mouth while the knights played their game
of nine-pins.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>No sooner had the Gnome concluded his story than a
funny looking fairy with feathers in his hair and hanging
in a stream all down his back—just like a Red Indian in
all his war-paint—exclaimed,</p>

<p>“Karl Katz, indeed, the people where I come from call
him Rip Van Winkle and he really—”</p>

<p>“Stop, my little friend,” said the king, “when we want
your very entertaining story we will ask you for it, no doubt
there are more folk than Karl Katz and your friend Rip
Van Winkle who have lived long with the fairies and gone
back after years to their own people.”</p>

<p>“History repeats itself,” said the Gnome sententiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">(64)</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” added Oberon, “and you have repeated enough,
so now we will have a story from someone else.”</p>

<p>The fairies all laughed at the king’s little sally, and
settled themselves down to hear the next tale, which was
given by the Fairy Peaseblossom, one of the attendants
upon Queen Titania who, knowing her Majesty’s favourite
story, told them of</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="the_wild_swans">The Wild Swans</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Far away, where the swallows take refuge in winter, lived
a king who had eleven sons and one daughter, Elise.
The eleven brothers—they were all princes—used to go to
school with stars on their breasts and swords at their sides.
They wrote upon golden slates with diamond pencils, and
could read just as well without a book as with one, so there
was no mistake about their being real princes. Their
sister Elise sat upon a little footstool of looking-glass, and
she had a picture-book which had cost the half of a
kingdom. Oh, these children were very happy; but it was
not to last thus for ever.</p>

<p>Their father, who was king over all the land, married a
wicked queen who was not at all kind to the poor children;
they found that out on the first day. All was festive at the
castle, but when the children wanted to play at having
company, instead of having as many cakes and baked
apples as ever they wanted, she would only let them have
some sand in a tea-cup, and said they must make-believe.</p>

<p>In the following week she sent little Elise into the
country to board with some peasants, and it did not take
her long to make the king believe so many bad things
about the boys, that he cared no longer for them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">(66)</span></p>

<p>“Fly out into the world and look after yourselves,”
said the wicked queen; “you shall fly about like birds
without voices.”</p>

<p>But she could not make things as bad for them as she
would have liked; they turned into eleven beautiful wild
swans. They flew out of the palace window with a weird
scream, right across the park and the woods.</p>

<p>It was very early in the morning when they came to the
place where their sister Elise was sleeping in the peasant’s
house. They hovered over the roof of the house, turning
and twisting their long necks, and flapping their wings;
but no one either heard or saw them. They had to fly
away again, and they soared up towards the clouds, far out
into the wide world, and they settled in a big, dark wood,
which stretched right down to the shore.</p>

<p>Poor little Elise stood in the peasant’s room, playing
with a green leaf, for she had no other toys. She made a
little hole in it, which she looked through at the sun, and
it seemed to her as if she saw her brothers’ bright eyes.
Every time the warm sunbeams shone upon her cheek, it
reminded her of their kisses. One day passed just like
another. When the wind whistled through the rose-hedges
outside the house, it whispered to the roses, “Who can
be prettier than you are?” But the roses shook their
heads and answered, “Elise!” And when the old woman
sat in the doorway reading her Psalms, the wind turned
over the leaves and said to the book, “Who can be more
pious than you?” “Elise!” answered the book. Both
the roses and the book of Psalms only spoke the truth.</p>

<p>She was to go home when she was fifteen, but when the
queen saw how pretty she was she got very angry, and her
heart was filled with hatred. She would willingly have
turned her into a wild swan too, like her brothers, but she did
not dare to do it at once, for the king wanted to see his
daughter. The queen always went to the bath in the early
morning. It was built of marble and adorned with soft
cushions and beautiful carpets.</p>

<p>She took three toads, kissed them, and said to the first,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">(67)</span>
“Sit upon Elise’s head when she comes to the bath, so
that she may become sluggish like yourself.” “Sit upon
her forehead,” she said to the second, “that she may
become ugly like you, and then her father won’t know her!
Rest upon her heart,” she whispered to the third. “Let
an evil spirit come over her, which may be a burden to
her.” Then she put the toads into the clean water, and a
green tinge immediately came over it. She called Elise,
undressed her, and made her go into the bath; when she
ducked under the water, one of the toads got among her
hair, the other got on to her forehead, and the third on to
her bosom. But when she stood up three scarlet poppies
floated on the water; had not the creatures been
poisonous, and kissed by the sorceress, they would have
been changed into crimson roses, but yet they became
flowers from merely having rested a moment on her head
and her heart. She was far too good and innocent for the
sorcery to have any power over her. When the wicked
Queen saw this, she rubbed her over with walnut juice, and
smeared her face with some evil-smelling salve. She also
matted up her beautiful hair; it would have been impossible
to recognise pretty Elise. When her father saw her, he
was quite horrified and said that she could not be his
daughter. Nobody would have anything to say to her,
except the yard dog, and the swallows, and they were only
poor dumb animals whose opinion went for nothing.</p>

<p>Poor Elise wept, and thought of her eleven brothers who
were all lost. She crept sadly out of the palace and
wandered about all day, over meadows and marshes, and
into a big forest. She did not know in the least where
she wanted to go, but she felt very sad, and longed for
her brothers, who, no doubt, like herself had been driven
out of the palace. She made up her mind to go and look
for them, but she had only been in the wood for a short
time when night fell. She had quite lost her way, so she
lay down upon the soft moss, said her evening prayer, and
rested her head on a little hillock. It was very still and
the air was mild, hundreds of glow-worms shone around<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">(68)</span>
her on the grass and in the marsh like green fire. When
she gently moved one of the branches over her head, the
little shining insects fell over her like a shower of stars.
She dreamt about her brothers all night long. Again
they were children playing together: they wrote upon the
golden slates with their diamond pencils, and she looked
at the picture-book which had cost half a kingdom. But
they no longer wrote strokes and noughts upon their
slates as they used to do; no, they wrote down all their
boldest exploits, and everything that they had seen and
experienced. Everything in the <span id="cor68">picture-book</span> was alive,
the birds sang, and the people walked out of the book,
and spoke to Elise and her brothers. When she turned
over a page, they skipped back into their places again,
so that there should be no confusion among the pictures.</p>

<p>When she woke the sun was already high; it is true she
could not see it very well through the thick branches of
the lofty forest trees, but the sunbeams cast a golden
shimmer around beyond the forest. There was a fresh
delicious scent of grass and herbs in the air, and the birds
were almost ready to perch upon her shoulders. She
could hear the splashing of water, for there were many
springs around, which all flowed into a pond with a lovely
sandy bottom. It was surrounded with thick bushes, but
there was one place which the stags had trampled down
and Elise passed through the opening to the water side.
It was so transparent, that had not the branches been
moved by the breeze, she must have thought that they
were painted on the bottom, so plainly was every leaf
reflected, both those on which the sun played, and those
which were in shade.</p>

<p>When she saw her own face she was quite frightened, it
was so brown and ugly, but when she wet her little hand
and rubbed her eyes and forehead, her white skin shone
through again. Then she took off all her clothes and
went into the fresh water. A more beautiful royal child
than she, could not be found in all the world.</p>

<p>When she had put on her clothes again, and plaited her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">(69)</span>
long hair, she went to a sparkling spring and drank some
of the water out of the hollow of her hand. Then she
wandered further into the wood, though where she was
going she had not the
least idea. She thought
of her brothers,
and she thought of
a merciful God who
would not forsake her.
He let the wild crab-apples
grow to feed the
hungry. He showed her
a tree, the branches of
which were bending beneath
their weight of
fruit. Here she made
her midday meal, and,
having put props under
the branches,
she walked on into the
thickest part of the
forest. It was so quiet
that she heard her
own footsteps, she
heard every little withered
leaf which bent
under her feet. Not
a bird was to be seen,
not a ray of sunlight
pierced the leafy
branches, and the tall trunks were so close together that
when she looked before her it seemed as if a thick fence
of heavy beams hemmed her in on every side. The solitude
was such as she had never known before.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp20" id="image069">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/image069.png"><img class="w100" src="images/image069_small.png" alt="" title="The Saviour looked down and little angels’ heads peeped out above His head and under His arms"></a>
</figure>

<p>It was a very dark night, not a single glow-worm
sparkled in the marsh; sadly she lay down to sleep, and it
seemed to her as if the branches above her parted asunder,
and the Saviour looked down upon her with His loving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">(70)</span>
eyes, and little angels’ heads peeped out above His head
and under His arms.</p>

<p>When she woke in the morning she was not sure if
she had dreamt this, or whether it was really true.</p>

<p>She walked a little further, when she met an old woman
with a basket full of berries, of which she gave her some.
Elise asked if she had seen eleven princes ride through
the wood. “No,” said the old woman, “but yesterday I
saw eleven swans, with golden crowns upon their heads,
swimming in the stream close by here.”</p>

<p>She led Elise a little further to a slope, at the foot of
which the stream meandered. The trees on either bank
stretched out their rich leafy branches towards each other,
and where, from their natural growth, they could not
reach each other, they had torn their roots out of the
ground, and leant over the water so as to interlace their
branches.</p>

<p>Elise said good-bye to the old woman, and walked
along by the river till it flowed out into the great open
sea.</p>

<p>The beautiful open sea lay before the maiden, but not
a sail was to be seen on it, not a single boat. How was
she ever to get any further? She looked at the numberless
little pebbles on the beach; they were all worn quite
round by the water. Glass, iron, stone, whatever was
washed up had taken their shapes from the water, which
yet was much softer than her little hand. “With all its
rolling, it is untiring, and everything hard is smoothed
down. I will be just as untiring! Thank you for your
lesson, you clear rolling waves! Some time, so my heart
tells me, you will bear me to my beloved brothers!”</p>

<p>Eleven white swans’ feathers were lying on the sea-weed;
she picked them up and made a bunch of them. There
were still drops of water on them. Whether these were
dew or tears no one could tell. It was very lonely there
by the shore, but she did not feel it, for the sea was
ever-changing. There were more changes on it in the
course of a few hours than could be seen on an inland<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">(71)</span>
fresh water lake in a year. If a big black cloud arose,
it was just as if the sea wanted to say, “I can look black
too,” and then the wind blew up and the waves shewed
their white crests. But if the clouds were red and the
wind dropped, the sea looked like a rose-leaf, now white,
now green. But however still it was, there was always
a little gentle motion just by the shore, the water rose
and fell softly like the bosom of a sleeping child.</p>

<p>When the sun was just about to go down, Elise saw
eleven wild swans with golden crowns upon their heads
flying towards the shore. They flew in a swaying line,
one behind the other, like a white ribbon streamer.
Elise climbed up on to the bank and hid behind a bush;
the swans settled close by her and flapped their great
white wings.</p>

<p>As soon as the sun had sunk beneath the water, the
swans shed their feathers and became eleven handsome
princes; they were Elise’s brothers. Although they had
altered a good deal, she knew them at once; she felt
that they must be her brothers and she sprang into their
arms, calling them by name. They were delighted when
they recognised their little sister who had grown so big
and beautiful. They laughed and cried, and told each
other how wickedly their stepmother had treated them all.</p>

<p>“We brothers,” said the eldest, “have to fly about in
the guise of swans, as long as the sun is above the horizon.
When it goes down we regain our human shapes. So
we always have to look out for a resting-place near sunset,
for should we happen to be flying up among the
clouds when the sun goes down, we should be hurled
to the depths below. We do not live here; there is
another land, just as beautiful as this beyond the sea;
but the way to it is very long and we have to cross the
mighty ocean to get to it. There is not a single island
on the way where we can spend the night, only one
solitary little rock juts up above the water midway. It is
only just big enough for us to stand upon close together,
and if there is a heavy sea the water splashes over us,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">(72)</span>
yet we thank our God for it. We stay there over night
in our human forms, and without it we could never revisit
our beloved Fatherland, for our flight takes two of the
longest days in the year. We are only permitted to
visit the home of our fathers once a year, and we dare
only stay for eleven days. We hover over this big forest
from whence we catch a glimpse of the palace where we
were born, and where our father lives; beyond it we can
see the high church towers where our mother is buried.
We fancy that the trees and bushes here are related to
us; and the wild horses gallop over the moors as we
used to see them in our childhood. The charcoal burners
still sing the old songs we used to dance to when we
were children. This is our Fatherland, we are drawn
towards it, and here we have found you again, dear little
sister! We may stay here two days longer, and then
we must fly away again across the ocean, to a lovely
country indeed, but it is not our own dear Fatherland!
How shall we ever take you with us, we have neither
ship nor boat!”</p>

<p>“How can I deliver you!” said their sister, and they
went on talking to each other, nearly all night, they
only dozed for a few hours.</p>

<p>Elise was awakened in the morning by the rustling
of the swans’ wings above her; her brothers were again
transformed and were wheeling round in great circles,
till she lost sight of them in the distance. One of them,
the youngest, stayed behind. He laid his head against
her bosom, and she caressed it with her fingers. They
remained together all day; towards evening the others
came back, and as soon as the sun went down they
took their natural forms.</p>

<p>“To-morrow we must fly away, and we dare not
come back for a whole year, but we can’t leave you
like this! Have you courage to go with us? My arm
is strong enough to carry you over the forest, so surely
our united strength ought to be sufficient to bear you
across the ocean.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">(73)</span></p>

<p>“Oh yes! take me with you,” said Elise.</p>

<p>They spent the whole night in weaving a kind of
net of the elastic bark of the willow bound together
with tough rushes; they made it both large and strong.
Elise lay down upon it, and when the sun rose and
the brothers became swans again, they took up the
net in their bills and flew high up among the clouds
with their precious sister, who was fast asleep. The
sunbeams fell straight on to her face, so one of the
swans flew over her head so that its broad wings should
shade her.</p>

<p>They were far from land when Elise woke; she
thought she must still be dreaming, it seemed so strange
to be carried through the air so high up above the
sea. By her side lay a branch of beautiful ripe berries,
and a bundle of savoury roots, which her youngest
brother had collected for her, and for which she gave
him a grateful smile. She knew it was he who flew
above her head shading her from the sun. They were
so high up that the first ship they saw looked like a
gull floating on the water. A great cloud came up
behind them like a mountain, and Elise saw the shadow
of herself on it, and those of the eleven swans looking
like giants. It was a more beautiful picture than any
she had ever seen before, but as the sun rose higher,
the cloud fell behind, and the shadow picture disappeared.</p>

<p>They flew on and on all day like an arrow whizzing
through the air, but they went slower than usual, for
now they had their sister to carry. A storm came up,
and night was drawing on; Elise saw the sun sinking
with terror in her heart, for the solitary rock was
nowhere to be seen. The swans seemed to be taking
stronger strokes than ever; alas! she was the cause
of their not being able to get on faster; as soon as the
sun went down they would become men, and they would
all be hurled into the sea and drowned. She prayed to
God from the bottom of her heart, but still no rock was
to be seen! Black clouds gathered, and strong gusts of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">(74)</span>
wind announced a storm; the clouds looked like a great
threatening leaden wave, and the flashes of lightning
followed each other rapidly.</p>

<p>The sun was now at the edge of the sea. Elise’s heart
quaked, when suddenly the swans shot downwards so
suddenly, that she thought they were falling, then they
hovered again. Half of the sun was below the horizon,
and there for the first time she saw the little rock below,
which did not look bigger than the head of a seal above
the water. The sun sank very quickly, it was no bigger
than a star, but her foot touched solid earth. The sun
went out like the last sparks of a bit of burning paper;
she saw her brothers stand arm in arm around her, but
there was only just room enough for them. The waves
beat upon the rock and washed over them like drenching
rain. The heavens shone with continuous fire, and the
thunder rolled, peal upon peal. But the sister and brothers
held each other’s hands and sang a psalm which gave them
comfort and courage.</p>

<p>The air was pure and still at dawn. As soon as the
sun rose the swans flew off with Elise, away from the
islet. The sea still ran high, it looked from where they
were as if the white foam on the dark green water were
millions of swans floating on the waves.</p>

<p>When the sun rose higher, Elise saw before her half
floating in the air great masses of ice, with shining glaciers
on the heights. A palace was perched midway a mile in
length, with one bold colonnade built above another. Beneath
them swayed palm trees and gorgeous blossoms as big as
mill wheels. She asked if this was the land to which she
was going, but the swans shook their heads, because what
she saw was a mirage; the beautiful and ever changing
palace of Fata Morgana. No mortal dared enter it. Elise
gazed at it, but as she gazed the palace, gardens and mountains
melted away, and in their place stood twenty proud
churches with their high towers and pointed windows. She
seemed to hear the notes of the organ, but it was the sea
she heard. When she got close to the seeming churches,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">(75)</span>
they changed to a great navy sailing beneath her; but it
was only a sea mist floating over the waters. Yes, she saw
constant changes passing before her eyes, and now she saw
the real land she was bound to. Beautiful blue mountains
rose before her with their cedar woods and palaces. Long
before the sun went down, she sat among the hills in front
of a big cave covered with delicate green creepers. It looked
like a piece of embroidery.</p>

<p>“Now we shall see what you will dream here to-night,”
said the youngest brother, as he showed her where she was
to sleep.</p>

<p>“If only I might dream how I could deliver you,” she
said, and this thought filled her mind entirely. She prayed
earnestly to God for His help, and even in her sleep she
continued her prayer. It seemed to her that she was flying
up to Fata Morgana in her castle in the air. The fairy came
towards her, she was charming and brilliant, and yet she was
very like the old woman who gave her the berries in the
wood, and told her about the swans with the golden crowns.</p>

<p>“Your brothers can be delivered,” she said, “but have
you courage and endurance enough for it? The sea is
indeed softer than your hands, and it moulds the hardest
stones, but it does not feel the pain your fingers will feel.
It has no heart, and does not suffer the pain and anguish
you must feel. Do you see this stinging nettle I hold in my
hand? Many of this kind grow round the cave where you
sleep; only these and the ones which grow in the churchyards
may be used. Mark that! Those you may pluck
although they will burn and blister your hands. Crush the
nettles with your feet and you will have flax, and of this you
must weave eleven coats of mail with long sleeves. Throw
these over the eleven wild swans and the charm is broken!
But remember that from the moment you begin this work,
till it is finished, even if it takes years, you must not utter a
word! The first word you say will fall like a murderer’s
dagger into the hearts of your brothers. Their lives hang
on your tongue. Mark this well!”</p>

<p>She touched her hand at the same moment, it was like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">(76)</span>
burning fire, and woke Elise. It was bright <span id="cor76">daylight</span>, and
close to where she slept lay a nettle like those in her
dream. She fell upon her knees with thanks to God and
left the cave to begin their work.</p>

<p>She seized the horrid nettles with her delicate hands,
and they burnt like fire; great blisters rose on her hands
and arms, but she suffered it willingly if only it would
deliver her beloved brothers. She crushed every nettle
with her bare feet, and twisted it into green flax.</p>

<p>When the sun went down and the brothers came back,
they were alarmed at finding her mute; they thought it
was some new witchcraft exercised by their wicked stepmother.
But when they saw her hands, they understood
that it was for their sakes; the youngest brother wept,
and wherever his tears fell, she felt no more pain, and the
blisters disappeared.</p>

<p>She spent the whole night at her work, for she could
not rest till she had delivered her dear brothers. All
the following day while her brothers were away she sat
solitary, but never had the time flown so fast. One coat
of mail was finished and she began the next. Then a
hunting-horn sounded among the mountains; she was
much frightened, the sound came nearer, and she heard
dogs barking. In terror she rushed into the cave and
tied the nettles she had collected and woven, into a bundle
upon which she sat.</p>

<p>At this moment a big dog bounded forward from the
thicket, and another and another, they barked loudly
and ran backwards and forwards. In a few minutes all
the huntsmen were standing outside the cave, and the
handsomest of them was the king of the country. He
stepped up to Elise: never had he seen so lovely a girl.</p>

<p>“How came you here, beautiful child?” he said.</p>

<p>Elise shook her head; she dared not speak; the salvation
and the lives of her brothers depended upon her silence.
She hid her hands under her apron, so that the king should
not see what she suffered.</p>

<p>“Come with me!” he said; “you cannot stay here<span id="cor76a">.</span><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">(77)</span>
If you are as good as you are beautiful, I will dress you
in silks and velvets, put a golden crown upon your head,
and you shall live with me and have your home in my
richest palace!” Then he lifted her upon his horse, she
wept and wrung her hands, but the king said, “I only
think of your happiness; you will thank me one day for
what I am doing!” Then he darted off across the
mountains, holding her before him on his horse, and the
huntsmen followed.</p>

<p>When the sun went down, the royal city with churches
and cupolas lay before them, and the king led her into
the palace, where great fountains played in the marble
halls, and where walls and ceilings were adorned with
paintings, but she had no eyes for them, she only wept
and sorrowed; passively she allowed the women to dress
her in royal robes, to twist pearls into her hair, and to
draw gloves on to her blistered hands.</p>

<p>She was dazzlingly lovely as she stood there in all her
magnificence; the courtiers bent low before her, and the
king wooed her as his bride, although the archbishop
shook his head, and whispered that he feared the beautiful
wood maiden was a witch, who had dazzled their eyes and
infatuated the king.</p>

<p>The king refused to listen to him, he ordered the music
to play, the richest food to be brought, and the loveliest
girls to dance before her. She was led through scented
gardens into gorgeous apartments, but nothing brought a
smile to her lips, or into her eyes, sorrow sat there like a
heritage and a possession for all time. Last of all, the
king opened the door of a little chamber close by the
room where she was to sleep. It was adorned with costly
green carpets, and made to exactly resemble the cave
where he found her. On the floor lay the bundle of flax
she had spun from the nettles, and from the ceiling hung
the shirt of mail which was already finished. One of the
huntsmen had brought all these things away as curiosities.</p>

<p>“Here you may dream that you are back in your
former home!” said the king. “Here is the work upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">(78)</span>
which you were engaged; in the midst of your splendour,
it may amuse you to think of those times.”</p>

<p>When Elise saw all these things so dear to her heart, a
smile for the first time played about her lips, and the
blood rushed back to her cheeks. She thought of the
deliverance of her brothers, and she kissed the king’s
hand; he pressed her to his heart, and ordered all the
church bells to ring marriage peals. The lovely dumb
girl from the woods was to be queen of the country.</p>

<p>The archbishop whispered evil words into the ear of the
king, but they did not reach his heart. The wedding was
to take place, and the archbishop himself had to put the
crown upon her head. In his anger he pressed the golden
circlet so tightly upon her head as to give her pain. But
a heavier circlet pressed upon her heart, her grief for her
brothers, so she thought nothing of the bodily pain. Her
lips were sealed, a single word from her mouth would cost
her brothers their lives, but her eyes were full of love for
the good and handsome king, who did everything he
could to please her. Every day she grew more and more
attached to him, and longed to confide in him, tell him her
sufferings; but dumb she must remain, and in silence
must bring her labour to completion. Therefore at night
she stole away from his side into her secret chamber,
which was decorated like a cave, and here she knitted one
shirt after another. When she came to the seventh, all
her flax was worked up; she knew that these nettles which
she was to use grew in the churchyard, but she had to
pluck them herself. How was she to get there? “Oh,
what is the pain of my fingers compared with the anguish
of my heart,” she thought. “I must venture out, the good
God will not desert me!” With as much terror in her
heart, as if she were doing some evil deed, she stole down
one night into the moonlit garden, and through the long
alleys out into the silent streets to the churchyard. There
she saw, sitting on a gravestone, a group of hideous ghouls,
who took off their tattered garments, as if they were about
to bathe, and then they dug down into the freshly-made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">(79)</span>
graves with their skinny fingers, and tore the flesh from the
bodies and devoured it. Elise had to pass close by them,
and they fixed their evil eyes upon her, but she said a
prayer as she passed, picked the stinging nettles and
hurried back to the palace with them.</p>

<p>Only one person saw her, but that was the archbishop,
who watched while others slept. Surely now all his bad
opinions of the queen were justified; all was not as it
should be with her, she must be a witch, and therefore
she had bewitched the king and all the people.</p>

<p>He told the king in the confessional what he had seen
and what he feared. When those bad words passed his
lips, the pictures of the saints shook their heads as if to
say: it is not so, Elise is innocent. The archbishop
however took it differently, and thought that they were
bearing witness against her, and shaking their heads at
her sin. Two big tears rolled down the king’s cheeks,
and he went home with doubt in his heart. He pretended
to sleep at night, but no quiet sleep came to his eyes. He
perceived how Elise got up and went to her private closet.
Day by day his face grew darker, Elise saw it but could
not imagine what was the cause of it. It alarmed her,
and what was she not already suffering in her heart because
of her brothers? Her salt tears ran down upon the royal
purple velvet, they lay upon it like sparkling diamonds,
and all who saw their splendour wished to be queen.</p>

<p>She had, however, almost reached the end of her labours,
only one shirt of mail was wanting, but again she had no
more flax and not a single nettle was left. Once more, for
the last time, she must go to the churchyard to pluck a few
handfuls. She thought with dread of the solitary walk
and the horrible ghouls; but her will was as strong as her
trust in God.</p>

<p>Elise went, but the king and the archbishop followed
her, they saw her disappear within the grated gateway of
the churchyard. When they followed they saw the ghouls
sitting on the gravestone as Elise had seen them before:
and the king turned away his head because he thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">(80)</span>
she was among them, she, whose head this very evening
had rested on his breast.</p>

<p>“The people must judge her,” he groaned, and the people
judged. “Let her be consumed in the glowing flames!”</p>

<p>She was led away from her beautiful royal apartments
to a dark damp dungeon, where the wind whistled through
the grated window. Instead of velvet and silk they gave
her the bundle of nettles she had gathered to lay her
head upon. The hard burning shirts of mail were to be
her covering, but they could have given her nothing more
precious.</p>

<p>She set to work again with many prayers to God.
Outside her prison the street boys sang derisive songs
about her, and not a soul comforted her with a kind word.</p>

<p>Towards the evening she heard the rustle of swans’ wings
close to her window; it was her youngest brother, at last
he had found her. He sobbed aloud with joy although
he knew that the coming night might be her last, but then
her work was almost done and her brothers were there.</p>

<p>The archbishop came to spend her last hours with her
as he had promised the king. She shook her head at
him, and by looks and gestures begged him to leave her.
She had only this night in which to finish her work,
or else all would be wasted, all—her pain, tears and
sleepless nights. The archbishop went away with bitter
words against her, but poor Elise knew that she was
innocent, and she went on with her work.</p>

<p>The little mice ran about the floor bringing nettles to
her feet, so as to give what help they could, and a thrush
sat on the grating of the window where he sang all night,
as merrily as he could to keep up her courage.</p>

<p>It was still only dawn, and the sun would not rise for
an hour when the eleven brothers stood at the gate of
the palace, begging to be taken to the king. This could
not be done, was the answer, for it was still night; the
king was asleep and no one dared wake him. All their
entreaties and threats were useless; the watch turned out
and even the king himself came to see what was the matter;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">(81)</span>
but just then the sun rose, and no more brothers were
to be seen, only eleven wild swans hovering over the
palace.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp40" id="image081">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/image081.png"><img class="w100" src="images/image081_small.png" alt="" title="Even on her way to her death she could not abandon her unfinished work"></a>
</figure>

<p>The whole populace
streamed out of the town
gates, they were all anxious
to see the witch burnt. A
miserable horse drew the
cart in which Elise was
seated. They had put upon
her a smock of green sacking,
and all her beautiful long hair hung loose from her
lovely head. Her cheeks were deathly pale, and her lips
moved softly, while her fingers unceasingly twisted the green
yarn. Even on the way to her death she could not
abandon her unfinished work. Ten shirts lay completed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">(82)</span>
at her feet—she laboured away at the eleventh, amid the
scoffing insults of the populace.</p>

<p>“Look at the witch how she mutters. She has never
a book of psalms in her hands, no, there she sits with
her loathsome sorcery. Tear it away from her, into a
thousand bits!”</p>

<p>The crowd pressed around her to destroy her work, but
just then eleven white swans flew down and perched upon
the cart flapping their wings. The crowd gave way before
them in terror.</p>

<p>“It is a sign from Heaven! She is innocent!” they
whispered, but they dared not say it aloud.</p>

<p>The executioner seized her by the hand, but she hastily
threw the eleven shirts over the swans, who were immediately
transformed to eleven handsome princes; but
the youngest had a swan’s wing in place of an arm, for
one sleeve was wanting to his shirt of mail, she had not
been able to finish it.</p>

<p>“Now I may speak! I am innocent.”</p>

<p>The populace who saw what had happened bowed down
before her as if she had been a saint, but she sank lifeless
in her brother’s arms; so great had been the strain, the
terror and the suffering she had endured.</p>

<p>“Yes, innocent she is indeed,” said the eldest brother,
and he told them all that had happened.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp10" id="image082">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/image082.png"><img class="w100" src="images/image082_small.png" alt=""></a>
</figure>

<p>Whilst he spoke a wonderful fragrance
spread around, as of millions of roses.
Every faggot in the pile had taken root
and shot out branches, and a great high
hedge of red roses had arisen. At the
very top was one pure white blossom,
it shone like a star, and the king broke
it off and laid it on Elise’s bosom, and
she woke with joy and peace in her heart.</p>

<p>All the church bells began to ring of
their own accord, and the singing birds flocked around
them. Surely such a bridal procession went back to the
palace as no king had ever seen before!</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">(83)</span></p>

<p>It was agreed that Peaseblossom had told a very pretty
story, and the fairy felt so flattered that he would have
liked to tell another but the king, turning to Titania, said:</p>

<p>“My queen, your Peaseblossom has told so charming a
story that perhaps another of your attendants will tell us
one also.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” answered the queen, gratified to find that
her favourite story was so well-liked by others. She
looked towards her little retinue of attendant fays and
wondered which one should be next. “Which shall it be?”
she asked, and they all stood up at once. “Moth, I think,
can tell us a pretty story of how a young man who had
been kind to the fairies was helped by them to kill a cruel
giant and to win a beautiful princess for his bride.”</p>

<p>“I can,” replied Moth readily, and skipped to the stool
by the throne where he at once began telling of the
adventures which befell</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="the_herd_boy">The Herd-Boy</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent">There was once a poor herd-boy,
who had neither kith nor kin except
his stepmother, who was a wicked woman, and hardly
allowed him food or clothing. Thus the poor boy suffered
great privation; during all the livelong day he had to
tend cattle, and scarcely ever got more than a morsel of
bread morning and evening.</p>

<p>One day his stepmother had gone out without leaving
him any food; he had, therefore, to drive his cattle to the
field fasting, and being very hungry, he wept bitterly.
But at the approach of noon he dried his tears, and went
up on a green hill, where he was in the habit of resting,
while the sun was hot in the summer. On this hill it was
always cool and dewy under the shady trees; but now he
remarked that there was no dew, that the ground was dry,
and the grass trampled down. This seemed to him very
singular, and he wondered who could have trodden down
the green grass. While thus sitting and thinking, he
perceived something that lay glittering in the sunshine.
Springing up to see what it might be, he found it was a
pair of very, very small shoes of the whitest and clearest
glass. The boy now felt quite happy again, forgot his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">(85)</span>
hunger, and amused himself the whole day with the little
glass shoes.</p>

<p>In the evening, when the sun had sunk behind the
forest, the herd-boy called his cattle and drove them to
the village. When he had gone some way, he was met
by a very little boy, who in a friendly tone greeted him
with “Good evening!” “Good evening again,” answered
the herd-boy. “Hast thou found my shoes, which I lost
this morning in the green grass?” asked the little boy.
The herd-boy answered: “Yes, I have found them; but,
my good little fellow, let me keep them. I intended to
give them to my stepmother, and then, perhaps, I should
have got a little meat, when I came home.” But the boy
prayed so earnestly, “Give me back my shoes; another
time I will be as kind to thee,” that the herd-boy returned
him the shoes. The little one then, greatly delighted,
gave him a friendly nod, and went springing away.</p>

<p>The herd-boy now collected his cattle together, and
continued his way homewards. When he reached his
dwelling it was already dark, and his stepmother chided
him for returning so late. “There’s still some porridge
in the pot,” said she; “eat now, and pack thyself off to
bed, so that thou canst get up in the morning betimes,
like other folks.” The poor herd-boy durst not return
any answer to these hard words, but ate, and then slunk
to bed in the hayloft, where he was accustomed to sleep.
The whole night he dreamed of nothing but the little boy
and his little glass shoes.</p>

<p>Early in the morning, before the sun shone from the
east, the boy was waked by his stepmother’s voice: “Up
with thee, thou sluggard! It is broad day, and the
animals are not to stand hungry for thy sloth.” He
instantly rose, got a bit of bread, and drove the cattle
to the pasture.</p>

<p>When he came to the green hill, which was wont to be
so cool and shady, he again wondered to see that the dew
was all swept from the grass, and the ground dry, even
more so than on the preceding day. While he thus sat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">(86)</span>
thinking, he observed something lying in the grass and
glittering in the bright sunshine. Springing towards it,
he found it was a very, very little red cap set round with
small golden bells. At this he was greatly delighted,
forgot his hunger, and amused himself all day with the
little elegant cap.</p>

<p>In the evening, when the sun had sunk behind the
forest, the herd-boy gathered his cattle together, and drove
them towards the village. When on his way, he was met
by a very little and, at the same time, very fair damsel.
She greeted him in a friendly tone with “Good evening!”
“Good evening again,” answered the lad. The damsel
then said: “Hast thou found my cap, which I lost this
morning in the green grass?” The boy answered: “Yes,
I have found it: but let me keep it, my pretty maid. I
thought of giving it to my wicked stepmother, and then,
perhaps, I shall get a little meat when I go home.” But
the little damsel entreated so urgently, “Give me back my
cap; another time I will be as good to thee,” that the
lad gave her the little cap, when she appeared highly
delighted, gave him a friendly nod, and sprang off.</p>

<p>On his return home, he was received as usual by his
cruel stepmother, and dreamed the whole night of the little
damsel and her little red cap.</p>

<p>In the morning he was turned out fasting, and on coming
to the hill, found it was drier than on either of the preceding
days, and that the grass was trodden down in large
rings. It then entered his mind all that he had heard of
the little <i>elves</i>, how in the summer nights they were wont
to dance in the dewy grass, and he found that these must
be <i>elfin-rings</i>, or <i>elfin-dances</i>. While sitting absorbed in
thought, he chanced to strike his foot against a little bell
that lay in the grass, and which gave forth so sweet a
sound, that all the cattle came running together, and stood
still to listen. Now the boy was delighted, and could do
nothing but play with the little bell, till he forgot his
troubles and the cattle forgot to graze. And so the day
passed much more quickly than can be imagined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">(87)</span></p>

<p>When it drew towards evening, and the sun was level
with the tree-tops, the boy called his cattle and prepared to
return home. But let him entice and call them as he
might, they were not to be drawn from the pasture, for it
was a delightful grassy spot. Then thought the boy to
himself, “Perhaps they will pay more heed to the little
bell.” So drawing forth the bell, he tingled it as he went
along the way. In one moment the bell-cow came running
after him, and was followed by the rest of the herd. At
this the boy was overjoyed, for he was well aware what an
advantage the little bell would be to him. As he was going
on, a very little old man met him, and kindly bade him a
good evening. “Good evening again,” said the boy. The
old man asked: “Hast thou found my little bell, which I
lost this morning in the green grass?” The herd-boy
answered: “Yes, I have found it.” The old man said:
“Then give it me back.” “No,” answered the boy, “I
am not so doltish as you may think. The day before
yesterday I found two small glass shoes, which a little boy
wheedled from me. Yesterday I found a cap, which I
gave to a little damsel; and now you come to take from
me the little bell, which is so good for calling the cattle.
Other finders get a reward for their pains, but I get
nothing.” The little man then used many fair words, with
the view of recovering his bell, but all to no purpose. At
last he said: “Give me back the little bell, and I will give
thee another, with which thou mayest call thy cattle; thou
shalt, moreover, obtain three wishes.” These seemed to
the boy no unfavourable terms, and he at once agreed to
them, adding, “As I may wish whatever I will, I will wish
to be a king, and I will wish to have a great palace, and
also a very beautiful queen.” “Thou hast wished no
trifling wishes,” said the old man, “but bear well in mind
what I now tell thee. To-night when all are sleeping, thou
shalt go hence, till thou comest to a royal palace, which lies
due north. Take this pipe of bone. If thou fallest into
trouble, blow it; if thou afterwards fallest into great trouble,
blow it again; but if, on a third occasion, thou findest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">(88)</span>
thyself in still greater peril, break the pipe in two, and I
will help thee, as I have promised.” The boy gave the
old man many thanks for his gifts, and the elf-king—for it
was he—went his way. But the boy bent his steps homewards,
rejoicing as he went along, that he should so soon
escape from tending cattle for his wicked stepmother.</p>

<p>When he reached the village it was already dark, and his
stepmother had been long awaiting his coming. She was
in a great rage, so that the poor lad got blows instead of
food. “This will not last long,” thought the boy, comforting
himself with the reflection, as he went up to his
hayloft, where he laid himself down and slumbered for a
short time. About midnight, long before the cock crew, he
arose, slipped out of the house, and began his journey in a
northward direction, as the old man had enjoined. He
travelled incessantly, over hill and dale, and twice did the
sun rise and twice set, while he was still on his way.</p>

<p>Towards evening on the third day he came to a royal
palace, which was so spacious that he thought he should
never again see the like. He went to the kitchen and
asked for employment. “What dost thou know, and what
canst thou do?” inquired the master-cook. “I can tend
cattle in the pasture,” answered the boy. The master-cook
said: “The king is in great want of a herd-boy; but it
will, no doubt, be with thee as with the others, that every
day thou losest one of the herd.” The boy answered:
“Hitherto I have never lost any beast that I drove to the
field.” He was then taken into the king’s service, and
tended the king’s cattle; but the wolf never got a beast
from him: so he was well esteemed by all the king’s
servants.</p>

<p>One evening, as the herd-boy was driving his cattle
home, he observed a beautiful young damsel standing at a
window and listening to his song. Though he seemed
hardly to notice her, he, nevertheless, felt a glow suffused
over him. Some time passed in this manner, the herd-boy
being delighted every time he saw the young maiden;
though he was still ignorant that she was the king’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">(89)</span>
daughter. It happened one day that the young girl came
to him as he was driving the herd to their pasture. She
had with her a little snow-white lamb, and begged him in
a friendly tone to take charge of her lamb, and protect it
from the wolves in the forest. At this the herd-boy was so
confused that he could neither answer nor speak. But he
took the lamb with him, and found his greatest pleasure in
guarding it, and the animal attached itself to him, as a dog
to its master. From that day the herd-boy frequently
enjoyed the sight of the fair princess. In the morning,
when he drove his cattle to the pasture, she would stand at
the window listening to his song; but in the evening, when
he returned from the forest, she would descend to caress
her little lamb, and say a few friendly words to the herd-boy.</p>

<p>Time rolled on. The herd-boy had grown up into a
comely, vigorous young man; and the princess had sprung
up and was become the fairest maiden that could be found
far or near. Nevertheless, she came every evening, according
to her early custom, to caress her lamb. But one day
the princess was missing and could nowhere be found.
This event caused a great sorrow and commotion in the
royal court, for the princess was beloved by every one; but
the king and queen, as was natural, grieved the most
intensely of all. The king sent forth a proclamation over
the whole land, that whosoever should recover his daughter
should be rewarded with her hand and half the kingdom.
This brought a number of princes, and knights, and warriors
from the east and the west. Cased in steel they rode forth
with arms and attendants, to seek the lost princess; but
few were they that returned from their wanderings, and
those that did return brought no tidings of her they went
in quest of. The king and queen were now inconsolable,
and thought that they had sustained an irreparable loss.
The herd-boy, as before, drove his cattle to the pasture
but it was in sadness, for the king’s fair daughter engrossed
his thoughts every day and every hour.</p>

<p>One night in a dream the little elfin king seemed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">(90)</span>
stand before him and to say: “To the north! to the north!
there thou wilt find thy queen.” At this the young man
was so overjoyed that he sprang up, and as he woke, there
stood the little man, who nodded to him, and repeated:
“To the north! to the north!” He then vanished, leaving
the youth in doubt whether or not it were an illusion. As
soon as it was day he went to the hall of the palace, and
requested an audience of the king. At this all the royal
servants wondered, and the master-cook said: “Thou hast
served for so many years that thou mayest, no doubt, get
thy wages increased without speaking to the king himself.”
But the young man persisted in his request, and let it be
understood that he had something very different in his
mind. On entering the royal apartment, the king demanded
his errand, when the young man said: “I have served you
faithfully for many years, and now desire permission to go
and seek for the princess.” Hereupon the king grew angry
and said: “How canst thou, a herd-boy, think of doing
that which no warrior nor prince has been able to accomplish?”
But the youth answered boldly, that he would
either discover the princess or, for her sake, lay down his
life. The king then let his anger pass, and called to mind
the old proverb: <i>A heart worthy of scarlet often lies under
a coarse woollen cloak.</i> He therefore gave orders that the
herd-boy should be equipped with a charger and all things
requisite. But the youth said: “I reck not of riding;
give me but your word and permission, together with means
sufficient.” The king then wished him success in his
enterprise; but all the boys and other servants in the court
laughed at the herd-boy’s rash undertaking.</p>

<p>The young man journeyed towards the north, as he had
been instructed by the elf-king, and proceeded on and on
until he could not be far distant from the world’s end.
When he had thus travelled over mountains and desolate
ways, he came at length to a great lake, in the midst of
which there was a fair island, and on the island a royal
palace, much more spacious than the one whence he
came. He went down to the water’s edge, and surveyed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">(91)</span>
the palace on every side. While thus viewing it, he perceived
a damsel with golden locks standing at one of the
windows, and making signs with a silken band, such as the
princess’s lamb was accustomed to wear. At this sight the
young man’s heart leaped in his breast; for it rushed into
his mind that the damsel could be no other than the
princess herself. He now began to consider how he should
cross over the water to the great palace; but could hit
upon no plan. At last the thought occurred to him that
he would make a trial whether the little elves would afford
him some assistance; and he took forth his pipe, and blew
a long-continued strain. He had scarcely ceased, when he
heard a voice behind him, saying “Good evening.” “Good
evening again,” answered the youth, turning about: when
just before him there stood the little boy whose glass shoes
he had found in the grass. “What dost thou wish of
me?” asked the elfin boy. The other answered: “I wish
thee to convey me across the water to the royal palace.”
The boy replied: “Place thyself on my back.” The youth
did so; and at the same instant the boy changed his form
and became an immensely huge hawk, that darted through
the air, and stopped not until it reached the island as the
young man had requested.</p>

<p>He now went up to the hall of the palace and asked for
employment. “What dost thou understand and what
canst thou do?” inquired the master-cook. “I can take
charge of cattle,” answered the youth. The master-cook
then said: “The giant is just now in great want of a
herdsman; but it will, I dare say, be with thee as with the
others; for if a beast by chance is lost, thy life is forfeited.”
The youth answered: “This seems to me a hard condition;
but I will, nevertheless, agree to it.” The master-cook then
accepted his service, and he was to commence on the
following day.</p>

<p>The young man now drove the giant’s cattle, and sung
his song, and rang his little bell, as he had formerly done;
and the princess sat at her window, and listened, and made
signs to him that he should not appear to notice her. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">(92)</span>
the evening he drove the herd from the forest, and was
met by the giant, who said to him: “Thy life is in the
place of any one that may be missing.” But not a beast
was wanting, let the giant count them as he would. Now
the giant was quite friendly, and said: “Thou shalt be my
herdsman all thy days.” He then went down to the lake,
loosed his enchanted ship, and rode thrice round the island,
as he was wont to do.</p>

<p>During the giant’s absence the princess stationed herself
at the window and sang:—</p>

<p>The young man listened to her song, and understood
from it that he was to go in the night and deliver the
princess. He therefore went away without appearing to
notice anything. But when it was late, and all were sunk
in deep sleep, he steadily approached the tower, placed
himself before the window, and sang:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“To-night will wait thy herdsman true,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">While the shadows fall so wildly.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The princess whispered: “I am bound with chains of
gold, come and break them.” The young man now knew
no other course than again to blow with his pipe a very
long-continued strain; when instantly he heard a voice
behind him saying “Good evening.” “Good evening
again,” answered the youth, looking round; when there
stood the little elf-king, from whom he had got the little
bell and the pipe. “What wilt thou with me?” inquired
the old man. The young man answered: “I beseech you
to convey me and the princess hence.” The little man
said “Follow me.” They then ascended to the maiden’s
tower; the castle gate opened spontaneously, and when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">(95)</span>
old man touched the chain, it burst in fragments. All
three then went down to the margin of the lake, when the
elf-king sang:—</p>

</figure>
</div>

<p>At the same moment appeared the little damsel, whose
cap the herd-boy had found in the grass. She sprang
down to the lake, and was instantly changed into a large
pike that sported about in the water. Then said the
elf-king: “Sit ye on the back of the pike. But the
princess must not be terrified, let what may happen; for
then will my power be at an end.” Having so said, the
old man vanished; but the youth and the fair princess
followed his injunctions, and the pike bore them rapidly
along through the billows.</p>

<p>While all this was taking place, the giant awoke, looked
through the window, and perceived the herd-boy floating
on the water together with the young princess. Instantly
snatching up his eagle-plumage, he flew after them. When
the pike heard the clapping of the giant’s wings, it dived
far down under the surface of the water, whereat the
princess was so terrified that she uttered a scream. Then
was the elf-king’s power at an end, and the giant seized
the two fugitives in his talons. On his return to the island
he caused the young herdsman to be cast into a dark
dungeon, full fifteen fathoms underground; but the princess
was again placed in her tower, and strictly watched, lest
she should again attempt to escape.</p>

<p>The youth now lay in the captives’ tower, and was in
deep affliction at finding himself unable to deliver the
princess, and, at the same time, having most probably
forfeited his own life. The words of the elfin king now
occurred to his memory: “If, on a third occasion, thou
findest thyself in great peril, break the pipe in two, and I
will help thee.” As a last resource, therefore, he drew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">(96)</span>
forth the little pipe and broke it in two. At the same
moment he heard behind him the words “Good evening.”
“Good evening again,” answered the youth; and when he
looked round there stood the little old man close by him,
who asked: “What wilt thou with me?” The young man
answered: “I wish to deliver the princess, and to convey
her home to her father.” The old man then led him
through many locked doors and many splendid apartments
till they came to a spacious hall, filled with all kinds of
weapons, swords, spears, and axes, of which some shone
like polished steel, others like burnished gold. The old
man kindled a fire on the hearth, and said: “Undress
thyself!” The young man did so, and the little man
burnt his old garments. He then went to a large iron
chest, out of which he took a costly suit of armour,
resplendent with the purest gold. “Dress thyself,” said
he: the young man did so. When he was thus armed
from head to foot, the old man bound a sharp sword by
his side, and said: “It is decreed that the giant shall fall
by this sword, and this armour no steel can penetrate.”
The young herdsman felt quite at ease in the golden
armour, and moved as gracefully as if he had been a prince
of the highest degree. They then returned to the dark
dungeon; the youth thanked the elf-king for his timely
succour, and they parted from each other.</p>

<p>Till a late hour there was a great bustle and hurrying
in the whole palace; for the giant was on that day to
celebrate his marriage with the beautiful princess, and had
invited many of his kin to the feast. The princess was
clad in the most sumptuous manner, and decorated with a
crown and rings of gold, and other costly ornaments, which
had been worn by the giant’s mother. The health of the
wedded pair was then drunk amid all kinds of rejoicing,
and there was no lack of good cheer, both of meat and
drink. But the bride wept without intermission, and her
tears were so hot that they felt like fire on her cheeks.</p>

<p>When night approached, and the giant was about to
conduct his bride to the nuptial chamber, he sent his pages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">(97)</span>
to fetch the young herdsman, who lay in the dungeon.
But when they entered the prison, the captive had disappeared,
and in his stead there stood a bold warrior, with
sword in hand, and completely armed. At this apparition
the young men were frightened and fled; but were
followed by the herdsman, who thus ascended to the court
of the palace, where the guests were assembled to witness
his death. When the giant cast his eyes on the doughty
warrior, he was exasperated, and exclaimed: “Out upon
thee, thou base Troll!” As he spoke his eyes became so
piercing that they saw through the young herdsman’s
armour; but the fearless youth said: “Here shalt thou
strive with me for thy fair bride.” The giant was not
inclined to stay, and was about to withdraw; but the
herdsman drew his sword, which blazed like a flame of fire.
When the giant recognized the sword, under which he was
doomed to fall, he was terror-struck and sank on the earth;
but the young herdsman advanced boldly, swung round
his sword, and struck a blow so powerful that the giant’s
head was separated from his carcase. Such was his end.</p>

<p>On witnessing this exploit, the wedding-guests were
overcome with fear, and departed, each to his home; but
the princess ran forth and thanked the brave herdsman for
having saved her. They
then proceeded to the
water, loosed the giant’s
enchanted ship, and rowed
away from the island. On
their arrival at the king’s
court, there was great
joy that the king
had recovered his
daughter, for whom he
had mourned so long.
There was afterwards a
sumptuous wedding, and the young herdsman obtained the
king’s fair daughter. They lived happily for very many
years, and had many beautiful children.</p>

<p>Moth’s story was liked very much and Titania was so
pleased that her two fairies had told such pretty tales
that she turned to the king saying,</p>

<p>“My dear Oberon, will not one of your people tell us a

<p>“Certainly,” replied the king, and he at once called
Puck to him and asked him if he did not know an
amusing story which he could tell them.</p>

<p>“Your Majesty,” said Puck, in a serious tone, “I can
tell you all the stories that have ever been told, or that

<h2 class="nobreak" id="the_nose_tree">The Nose-Tree</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Did you ever hear the story of
the <i>three poor soldiers</i>, who, after
having fought hard in the wars, <i>set
out on their road home</i>, begging their
way as they went?</p>

<p>They had journeyed on a long
way, sick at heart with their bad luck
at thus being turned loose on the
world in their old days; when one
evening they reached a deep gloomy
wood, through which lay their road.
Night came fast upon them, and
they found that they must, however
unwillingly, sleep in this wood; so,
to make all as safe as they could, it
was agreed that two should lie down
and sleep, while a third sat up and watched, lest wild beasts
should break in and tear them to pieces. When he was
tired he was to wake one of the others, and sleep in his
turn; and so on with the third, so as to share the work
fairly among them.</p>

<p>The two who were to rest first soon lay down and fell
fast asleep; and the other made himself a good fire under
the trees, and sat down by its side to keep watch. He had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">(100)</span>
not sat long before, all of a sudden, up came a little dwarf
in a red jacket. “Who is there?” said he. “A friend,”
said the soldier. “What sort of a friend?” “An old
broken soldier,” said the other, “with his two comrades,
who have nothing left to live on; come, sit down and warm
yourself.” “Well, my worthy fellow,” said the little man,
“I will do what I can for you; take this and show it to
your comrades in the morning.” So he took out an old
cloak and gave it to the soldier: telling him, that whenever
he put it over his shoulders anything that he wished for
would be done for him. Then the little man made him a
bow and walked away.</p>

<p>The second soldier’s turn to watch soon came, and the
first laid him down to sleep; but the second man had not
sat by himself long before up came the dwarf in the red
jacket again. The soldier treated him in as friendly a way
as his comrade had done, and the little man gave him a
purse, which he told him would be always full of gold, let
him draw as much as he would out of it.</p>

<p>Then the third soldier’s turn to watch came; and he
also had little Red-jacket for his guest, who gave him a
wonderful horn, that drew crowds around it whenever it
was played, and made every one forget his business to
come and dance to its beautiful music.</p>

<p>In the morning each told his story, and showed the
gift he had got from the elf: and as they all liked each
other very much, and were old friends, they agreed to
travel together to see the world, and, for a while, only to
make use of the wonderful purse. And thus they spent
their time very joyously; till at last they began to be tired
of this roving life, and thought they should like to have
a home of their own. So the first soldier put his old
cloak on, and wished for a fine castle. In a moment it
stood before their eyes: fine gardens and green lawns
spread round it, and flocks of sheep, and goats, and herds
of oxen were grazing about; and out of the gate came a
grand coach with three dapple-grey horses, to meet them
and bring them home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">(101)</span></p>

<p>All this was very well for a time, but they found it
would not do to stay at home always; so they got together
all their rich clothes, and jewels, and money, and
ordered their coach with three dapple-grey horses, and set
out on a journey to see a neighbouring king. Now this
king had an only daughter, and as he saw the three soldiers
travelling in such grand style, he took them for king’s sons,
and so gave them a kind welcome. One day, as the
second soldier was walking with the princess, she saw that
he had the wonderful purse in his hand. Then she asked
him what it was, and he was foolish enough to tell her,—though,
indeed, it did not much signify what he said, for
she was a fairy, and knew all the wonderful things that the
three soldiers brought. Now this princess was very cunning
and artful; so she set to work and made a purse, so like the
soldier’s that no one would know the one from the other;
and then she asked him to come and see her, and made
him drink some wine that she had got ready for him, and
which soon made him fall fast asleep. Then she felt in
his pocket, and took away the wonderful purse, and left
the one she had made in its place.</p>

<p>The next morning the soldiers set out home; and soon
after they reached their castle, happening to want some
money, they went to their purse for it, and found something
indeed in it; but to their great sorrow, when they
had emptied it, none came in the place of what they took.
Then the cheat was soon found out; for the second
soldier knew where he had been, and how he had told
the story to the princess, and he guessed that she had
played him a trick. “Alas!” cried he, “poor wretches
that we are, what shall we do?” “Oh!” said the first
soldier, “let no grey hairs grow for this mishap: I will
soon get the purse back.” So he threw his cloak across his
shoulders, and wished himself in the princess’s chamber.</p>

<p>There he found her sitting alone, telling up her gold, that
fell around her in a shower from the wonderful purse.</p>

<p>But the soldier stood looking at her too long; for she
turned round, and the moment she saw him she started up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">(102)</span>
and cried out with all her force, “Thieves! thieves!” so
that the whole court came running in, and tried to seize
on him. The poor soldier now began to be dreadfully
frightened in his turn, and thought it was high time to
make the best of his way off; so, without thinking of the
ready way of travelling that his cloak gave him, he ran to
the window, opened it, and jumped out; and unluckily, in
his haste, his cloak caught and was left hanging, to the
great joy of the princess, who knew its worth.</p>

<p>The poor soldier made the best of his way home to his
comrades on foot, and in a very downcast mood; but the
third soldier told him to keep up his heart, and took his
horn and blew a merry tune. At the first blast a countless
troop of foot and horse come rushing to their aid, and they
set out to make war against their enemy. Then the king’s
palace was besieged, and he was told that he must give up
the purse and cloak, or that not one stone should be left
upon another. And the king went into his daughter’s
chamber and talked with her; but she said, “Let me try
first if I cannot beat them some way or another.” So she
thought of a cunning scheme to overreach them; and
dressing herself out as a poor girl, with a basket on her
arm, she set out by night with her maid, and went into
the enemy’s camp, as if she wanted to sell trinkets.</p>

<p>In the morning she began to ramble about, singing
ballads so beautifully that all the tents were left empty,
and the soldiers ran round in crowds, and thought of
nothing but hearing her sing. Amongst the rest came
the soldier to whom the horn belonged, and as soon as
she saw him she winked to her maid, who slipped slily
through the crowd, and went into his tent where it hung,
and stole it away. This done, they both got safely back
to the palace, the besieging army went away, the three
wonderful gifts were all left in the hands of the princess,
and the three soldiers were as penniless and forlorn as
when little Red-jacket found them in the wood.</p>

<p>Poor fellows! they began to think what was now to be
done. “Comrades,” at last said the second soldier, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">(103)</span>
had had the purse,
“we had better
part; we cannot
live together, let each
seek his bread as well
as he can.” So he
turned to the right, and
the other two went to
the left, for they said
they would rather travel together. The
second soldier strayed on till he came
to a wood (now this was the same wood where
they had met with so much good luck before),
and he walked on a long time till evening began
to fall, when he sat down tired beneath a tree,
and soon fell asleep.</p>

<div class="chapter fullpage">
<figure class="figcenter illowp40 fullpage" id="image103">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/image103.png"><img class="fullpage" src="images/image103_small.png" alt="" title="Still it grew and grew"></a>
</figure>
</div>

<p>Morning dawned, and he was greatly delighted,
at opening his eyes, to see that the tree
was laden with the most beautiful apples. He
was hungry enough, so he soon plucked and ate
first one, then a second, then a third apple. A
strange feeling came over his nose: when he put
the apple to his mouth something was in the way.
He felt it—it was his nose, that grew and grew
till it hung down to his breast. It did not stop
there—still it grew and grew. “Heavens!”
thought he, “When will it have done growing?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">(104)</span>
And well might he ask, for by this time it reached the ground
as he sat on the grass,—and thus it kept creeping on, till
he could not bear its weight or raise himself up; and it
seemed as if it would never end, for already it stretched its
enormous length all through the wood, over hill and dale.</p>

<p>Meantime his comrades were journeying on, till on a
sudden one of them stumbled against something. “What
can that be?” said the other. They looked, and could
think of nothing that it was like but a nose. “We will
follow it and find its owner, however,” said they. So they
traced it up, till at last they found their poor comrade,
lying stretched along under the apple-tree.</p>

<p>What was to be done? They tried to carry him, but in
vain. They caught an ass that was passing, and raised
him upon its back; but it was soon tired of carrying such
a load. So they sat down in despair, when before long
up came their old friend the dwarf with the red jacket.
“Why, how now, friend?” said he, laughing: “well, I
must find a cure for you, I see.” So he told them to gather
a pear from another tree that grew close by, and the nose
would come right again. No time was lost; and the nose
was soon brought to its proper size to the poor soldier’s joy.</p>

<p>“I will do something more for you yet,” said the dwarf:
“take some of those pears and apples with you; whoever
eats one of the apples will have his nose grow like yours
just now; but if you give him a pear, all will come right
again. Go to the princess, and get her to eat some of your
apples; her nose will grow twenty times as long as yours did:
then look sharp, and you will get what you want from her.”</p>

<p>Then they thanked their old friend very heartily for
all his kindness; and it was agreed that the poor soldier,
who had already tried the power of the apple, should
undertake the task. So he dressed himself up as a
gardener’s boy, and went to the king’s palace, and said
he had apples to sell, so fine and so beautiful as were
never seen there before. Every one that saw them was
delighted, and wanted to taste; but he said they were
only for the princess; and she soon sent her maid to buy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">(107)</span>
his stock. They were so ripe and rosy that she soon
began eating; and had not eaten above a dozen before she
too began to wonder what ailed her nose, for it grew and
grew down to the ground, out at the window, and over the
garden, and away, nobody knows where.</p>

<div class="chapter fullpage">
<figure class="figcenter illowp40 fullpage" id="image105">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/image105.png"><img class="fullpage" src="images/image105_small.png" alt="" title="“We will follow it and find its owner”"></a>
</figure>
</div>

<p>Then the king made known to all his kingdom that
whoever would heal her of this dreadful disease should be
richly rewarded. Many tried, but the princess got no
relief. And now the old soldier dressed himself up very
sprucely as a doctor, and said he could cure her. So he
chopped up some of the apple, and, to punish her a little
more, gave her a dose, saying he would call to-morrow
and see her again. The morrow came, and, of course,
instead of being better, the nose had been growing on all
night as before; and the poor princess was in a dreadful
fright. So the doctor then chopped up a very little of the
pear and gave her, and said he was sure that would do
good, and he would call again the next day. Next day came,
and the nose was to be sure a little smaller, but yet it was
bigger than when the doctor first began to meddle with it.</p>

<p>Then he thought to himself, “I must frighten this
cunning princess a little more before I shall get what I
want from her”; so he gave her another dose of the apple,
and said he would call on the morrow. The morrow
came, and the nose was ten times as bad as before. “My
good lady,” said the doctor, “something works against my
medicine, and is too strong for it; but I know by the
force of my art what it is; you have stolen goods about
you, I am sure; and if you do not give them back, I can
do nothing for you.” But the princess denied very stoutly
that she had anything of the kind. “Very well,” said the
doctor, “you may do as you please, but I am sure I am
right, and you will die if you do not own it.” Then he
went to the king, and told him how the matter stood.
“Daughter,” said he, “send back the cloak, the purse,
and the horn, that you stole from the right owners.”</p>

</figure>

<p>Then she ordered her maid to fetch all three, and gave
them to the doctor, and begged him to give them back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">(108)</span>
to the soldiers; and the moment he had them safe he
gave her a whole pear to eat, and the nose came right.
And as for the doctor, he put on the cloak, wished the
king and all his court a good day, and
was soon with his two brothers; who
lived from that time happily at home in
their palace, except when they took an
airing to see the world, in their coach with
the three dapple-grey horses.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Puck’s story made all laugh,
and the more so because he
artfully contrived a loud sneeze at the finish of it and
set everybody thinking of what would have happened had
the afflicted soldier or princess been given a pinch of snuff
by some mischievous person passing by the
ends of their noses. By a quick jerk
forward Puck somersaulted on to the
steps of Oberon’s throne where he made
a low bow to the fairy king and
queen and then jumped to a thin
branch of a shrub growing near
where crossing his legs again in
his favourite attitude he swung
gently to and fro waiting for the
next <span id="cor108">story-teller</span>. Who was it to
be?</p>

<p>“Can we not have a song?” asked Titania.</p>

<p>“My queen speaks to be obeyed,” replied
Oberon; “Robin, let us hear that song in
which you tell of your doings among the
mortals.”</p>

<p>Robin Goodfellow was never far away from
the king, and at the royal request he
promptly moved to the stool and standing
up on it at once began the song
that tells of</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">There was once a poor widow who had three
sons. The two elder went out to work for their
living and while at home they were of little use, as they
seldom did as their mother wished, whatever she might
say to them. But the youngest lad always remained at
home, and helped the old widow in her daily occupations.
Hence he was much beloved by his mother, but disliked by
his brothers, who in mockery gave him the nickname of
<i>Pinkel</i>.</p>

<p>One day the old widow said to her sons: “You must
now go abroad in the world, and seek your fortunes while
you can. I am no longer able to feed you here at home,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">(118)</span>
now that you are grown up.” The lads answered that they
wished for nothing better, since it was contrary to their
mother’s will that they should remain at home. They then
prepared for their departure, and set out on their journey;
but, after wandering about from place to place, were unable
to procure any employment.</p>

<p>After journeying thus for a long time, they came, late one
evening, to a vast lake. Far out in the water there was an
island, on which there appeared a strong light, as of fire.
The lads stopped on shore observing the wondrous light,
and thence concluded that there must be human beings in
the place. As it was now dark, and the brothers knew not
where to find a shelter for the night, they resolved on taking
a boat that lay among the reeds, and rowing over to the island
to beg a lodging. With this view they placed themselves in
the boat and rowed across. On approaching the island they
perceived a little hut standing at the water’s edge; on reaching
which they discovered that the bright light, that shone
over the neighbourhood, proceeded from a golden lantern,
that stood at the door of the hut. In the yard without, a
large goat was wandering about, with golden horns, to which
small bells were fastened, that gave forth a pleasing sound
whenever the animal moved. The brothers wondered much
at all this, but most of all at the old crone, who with her
daughter inhabited the hut. The crone was both old and ugly,
but was sumptuously clad in a pelisse or cloak, worked so
artificially with golden threads that it glittered like burnished
gold in every hem. The lads saw now very clearly that they
had come to no ordinary human being, but to a Troll.</p>

<p>After some deliberation the brothers entered, and saw the
crone standing by the fire-place, and stirring with a ladle in
a large pot that was boiling on the hearth. They told their
story and prayed to be allowed to pass the night there; but
the crone answered <em>no</em>, at the same time directing them to a
royal palace, which lay on the other side of the lake. While
speaking she kept looking intently on the youngest boy, as
he was standing and casting his eyes over everything in the
hut. The crone said to him: “What is thy name, my boy?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">(119)</span>
The lad answered smartly: “I am called Pinkel.” The Troll
then said: “Thy brothers can go their way, but thou shalt
stay here; for thou appearest to me very crafty, and my mind
tells me that I have no good to expect from thee, if thou
shouldst stay long at the king’s palace.” Pinkel now humbly
begged to be allowed to accompany his brothers, and promised
never to cause the crone harm or annoyance. At
length he also got leave to depart; after which the brothers
hastened to the boat, not a little glad that all three had
escaped so well in this adventure.</p>

<p>Towards the morning they arrived at a royal palace,
larger and more magnificent than anything they had ever
seen before. They entered and begged for employment.
The eldest two were received as helpers in the royal stables,
and the youngest was taken as page to the king’s young son;
and, being a sprightly intelligent lad, he soon won the good-will
of every one, and rose from day to day in the king’s
favour. At this his brothers were sorely nettled, not enduring
that he should be preferred to themselves. At length
they consulted together how they might compass the fall
of their young brother, in the belief that afterwards they
should prosper better than before.</p>

<p>They therefore presented themselves one day before the
king, and gave him an exaggerated account of the beautiful
lantern that shed light over both land and water, adding that
it ill beseemed a king to lack so precious a jewel. On hearing
this the king’s attention was excited, and he asked: “Where
is this lantern to be found, and who can procure it for me?”
The brothers answered: “No one can do that unless it be
our brother Pinkel. He knows best where the lantern is to
be found.” The king was now filled with desire to obtain
the golden lantern, about which he had heard tell, and commanded
the youth to be called. When Pinkel came, the king
said: “If thou canst procure me the golden lantern, that
shines over land and water, I will make thee the chief man
in my whole court.” The youth promised to do his best to
execute his lord’s behest, and the king praised him for his
willingness; but the brothers rejoiced at heart; for they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">(120)</span>
well knew it was a perilous undertaking, which could hardly
terminate favourably.</p>

<p>Pinkel now prepared a little boat, and, unaccompanied
by any one, rowed over to the island inhabited by the Troll
crone. When he arrived it was already evening, and the
crone was busied in boiling porridge for supper, as was her
custom. The youth creeping softly up to the roof, cast from
time to time a handful of salt through the chimney, so that
it fell down into the pot that was boiling on the hearth. When
the porridge was ready, and the crone had begun to eat, she
could not conceive what had made it so salt and bitter. She
was out of humour, and chided her daughter, thinking that
she had put too much salt into the porridge; but let her
dilute the porridge as she might, it could not be eaten, so
salt and bitter was it. She then ordered her daughter to
go to the well, that was just at the foot of the hill, and
fetch water, in order to prepare fresh porridge. The maiden
answered: “How can I go to the well? It is so dark out
of doors, that I cannot find the way over the hill.” “Then
take my gold lantern,” said the crone peevishly. The girl
took the beautiful gold lantern accordingly, and hastened
away to fetch the water. But as she stooped to lift the pail,
Pinkel, who was on the watch, seized her by the feet, and
cast her headlong into the water. He then took the golden
lantern, and betook himself in all haste to his boat.</p>

<p>In the meantime the crone was wondering why her
daughter stayed out so long, and, at the same moment,
chancing to look through the window she saw the light
gleaming far out on the water. At this sight she was sorely
vexed, and, hurrying down to the shore, cried aloud: “Is
that thou, Pinkel?” The youth answered: “Yes, dear
mother, it is I.” The Troll continued: “art thou not a
great knave?” The lad answered: “Yes, dear mother, I
am so.” The crone now began to lament and complain,
saying: “Ah! what a fool was I to let thee go from me; I
might have been sure thou wouldst play me some trick. If
thou ever comest hither again, thou shalt not escape.” And
so the matter rested for that time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">(121)</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp40" id="image121">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/image121.png"><img class="w100" src="images/image121_small.png" alt="" title="Pinkel seized her by the feet and cast her headlong into the water"></a>
</figure>

<p>Pinkel now returned to the king’s palace, and became
the chief person at court, as the king had promised. But
when the brothers were informed what complete success he
had had in his adventure,
they became yet more
envious and embittered
than before, and often
consulted together how they
might accomplish the fall of
their young brother, and gain the king’s
favour for themselves<span id="cor121">.</span></p>

<p>Both brothers went, therefore, a second time
before the king, and began relating at full length
about the beautiful goat that had horns of the purest gold,
from which little gold bells were suspended, which gave forth
a pleasing sound, whenever the animal moved. They added,
that it ill became so rich a king to lack so costly a treasure.
On hearing their story, the king was greatly excited, and said:
“Where is this goat to be found, and who can procure it
for me?” The brothers answered: “That no one can do,
unless it be our brother Pinkel; for he knows best where
the goat is to be found.” The king then felt a strong<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">(122)</span>
desire to possess the goat with the golden horns, and
therefore commanded the youth to appear before him.
When Pinkel came, the king said: “Thy brothers have
been telling me of a beautiful goat with horns of the purest
gold, and little bells fastened to the horns, which ring
whenever the animal moves. Now it is my will that thou
go and procure for me this goat. If thou art successful I
will make thee lord over a third part of my kingdom.” The
youth having listened to this speech, promised to execute
his lord’s commission, if only fortune would befriend him.
The king then praised his readiness, and the brothers were
glad at heart, believing that Pinkel would not escape this
time so well as the first.</p>

<p>Pinkel now made the necessary preparations and rowed
to the island where the Troll-wife dwelt. When he reached
it, evening was already advanced, and it was dark, so that
no one could be aware of his coming, the golden lantern
being no longer there, but shedding its light in the royal
palace. The youth now deliberated with himself how to
get the golden goat; but the task was no easy one; for
the animal lay every night in the crone’s hut. At length
it occurred to his mind that there was one method which
might probably prove successful, though, nevertheless,
sufficiently difficult to carry into effect.</p>

<p>At night, when it was time for the crone and her
daughter to go to bed, the girl went as usual to bolt the
door. But Pinkel was just outside on the watch, and had
placed a piece of wood behind the door, so that it would
not shut close. The girl stood for a long time trying to
lock it but to no purpose. On perceiving this the crone
thought there was something out of order, and called out,
that the door might very well remain unlocked for the
night; as soon as it was daylight they could ascertain what
was wanting. The girl then left the door ajar and laid
herself down to sleep. When the night was a little more
advanced, and the crone and her daughter were snug in deep
repose, the youth stole softly into the hut, and approached
the goat where he lay stretched out on the hearth. Pinkel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">(123)</span>
now stuffed wool into all the golden bells, lest their sound
might betray him; then seizing the goat, he bore it off to
his boat. When he had reached the middle of the lake,
he took the wool out of the goat’s ears, and the animal
moved so that the bells rang aloud. At the sound the
crone awoke, ran down to the water, and cried in an angry
tone: “Is that thou, Pinkel?” The youth answered:
“Yes, dear mother, it is.” The crone said: “Hast thou
stolen my gold goat?” The youth answered: “Yes, dear
mother, I have.” The Troll continued: “Art thou not a
big knave?” Pinkel returned for answer: “Yes, I am so,
dear mother.” Now the beldam began to whine and complain
saying: “Ah! what a simpleton was I for letting thee
slip away from me. I well knew thou wouldst play me some
trick. But if thou comest hither ever again, thou shalt
never go hence.”</p>

<p>Pinkel now returned to the king’s court and obtained the
government of a third part of the kingdom, as the king had
promised. But when the brothers heard how the enterprise
had succeeded, and also saw the beautiful lantern and
the goat with golden horns, which were regarded by every
one as great wonders, they became still more hostile and
embittered than ever. They could think of nothing but
how they might accomplish his destruction.</p>

<p>They went, therefore, one day again before the king, to
whom they gave a most elaborate description of the Troll-crone’s
fur cloak, that shone like the brightest gold, and
was worked with golden threads in every seam. The
brothers said, it was more befitting a queen than a Troll to
possess such a treasure, and added that that alone was
wanting to the king’s good fortune. When the king heard
all this he became very thoughtful, and said: “Where is
this cloak to be found, and who can procure it for me?”
The brothers answered: “No one can do that except our
brother Pinkel; for he knows best where the gold cloak is to
be found.” The king was thereupon seized with an ardent
longing to possess the gold cloak, and commanded the
youth to be called before him. When Pinkel came, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">(124)</span>
king said: “I have long been aware that thou hast an
affection for my young daughter; and thy brothers have
been telling me of a beautiful fur cloak, which shines with
the reddest gold in every seam. It is, therefore, my will
that thou go and procure for me this cloak. If thou art
successful, thou shalt be my son-in-law, and after me
shalt inherit the kingdom.” When the youth heard this
he was glad beyond measure, and promised either to win
the young maiden, or perish in the attempt. The king
thereupon praised his readiness; but the brothers were
delighted in their false hearts, and trusted that that enterprise
would prove their brother’s destruction.</p>

<p>Pinkel then betook himself to his boat and crossed over
to the island inhabited by the Troll-crone. On the way
he anxiously deliberated with himself how he might get
possession of the crone’s gold cloak; but it appeared to
him not very likely that his undertaking would prove
successful, seeing that the Troll always wore the cloak
upon her. So after having concerted divers plans, one
more hazardous than another, it occurred to him, that he
would try one method, which might perhaps succeed,
although it was bold and rash.</p>

<p>In pursuance of his scheme he bound a bag under
his clothes, and walked with trembling step and humble
demeanour into the beldam’s hut. On perceiving him,
the Troll cast on him a savage glance, and said: “Pinkel,
is that thou?” The youth answered: “Yes, dear mother,
it is.” The crone was overjoyed, and said: “Although
thou art come voluntarily into my power, thou canst not
surely hope to escape again from hence, after having played
me so many tricks.<span id="cor124">”</span> She then took a large knife and
prepared to make an end of poor Pinkel; but the youth,
seeing her design, appeared sorely terrified, and said: “If
I must needs die, I think I might be allowed to choose
the manner of my death. I would rather eat myself to
death with milk-porridge, than be killed with a knife.”
The crone thought to herself that the youth had made a
bad choice, and therefore promised to comply with his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">(127)</span>
wish. She then set a huge pot on the fire, in which she
put a large quantity of porridge. When the mess was
ready, she placed it before Pinkel that he might eat, who
for every spoonful of porridge that he put into his mouth,
poured two into the bag that was tied under his clothes.
At length the crone began to wonder how Pinkel could
contrive to swallow such a quantity; but just at the same
moment the youth, making a show of being sick to death,
sank down from his seat as if he were dead, and unobserved
cut a hole in the bag, so that the porridge ran over the
floor.</p>

<p>The crone, thinking that Pinkel had burst with the
quantity of porridge he had eaten, was not a little glad,
clapped her hands together, and ran off to look for her
daughter, who was gone to the well. But as the weather
was wet and stormy, she first took off her beautiful fur
cloak and laid it aside in the hut. Before she could have
proceeded far, the youth came to life again, and springing
up like lightning, seized on the golden cloak, and ran off
at the top of his speed.</p>

<p>Shortly after, the crone perceived Pinkel as he was
rowing in his little boat. On seeing him alive again, and
observing the gold cloak glittering on the surface of the
water, she was angry beyond all conception, and ran far
out on the strand, crying: “Is that thou, Pinkel?” The
youth answered: “Yes, it is I, dear mother.” The crone
said: “Hast thou taken my beautiful gold cloak?” Pinkel
responded: “Yes, dear mother, I have.” The Troll
continued: “Art thou not a great knave?” The youth
replied: “Yes, I am so, dear mother.” The old witch
was now almost beside herself, and began to whine and
lament, and said: “Ah! how silly was it of me to let thee
slip away. I was well assured thou wouldst play me
many wicked tricks.” They then parted from each other.</p>

<p>The Troll-wife now returned to her hut, and Pinkel
crossed the water, and arrived safely at the king’s palace;
there he delivered the gold cloak, of which every one said
that a more sumptuous garment was never seen nor heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">(128)</span>
of. The king honourably kept his word with the youth,
and gave him his young daughter to wife. Pinkel afterwards
lived happy and content to the end of his days;
but his brothers were and
continued to be helpers in
the stable as long as they
lived.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>When the Swedish Troll had
finished the story of Pinkel’s adventures
a German Fairy took up
her position on the stool and said
that she would be very glad to tell a tale only
there were so many in the country from which
she had come that she really didn’t know
which one they would like best.</p>

<p>“Can we not have a story about children?” asked Queen
Titania.</p>

<p>The German Fairy considered for a moment and then
said that she did know a pretty story about children, a
story which many children liked to hear and one which
they called the Sweety-House, because it told how a little
boy and girl when lost in the woods found
a house built of nothing but sweets and
cakes, and of the adventures which befel
them afterwards when pursued by a bad
wicked fairy who was a disgrace to the
name.</p>

<p>“The Sweety-House, the Sweety-House,”
exclaimed Titania clapping her hands delightedly.</p>

<p>“The <em>proper</em> name of the story,” said
the German Fairy, “is</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="hansel_and_grethel">Hansel and Grethel</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent">There was once a poor man, who was a woodman, and
went every day to cut wood in the forest. Once as he
went along, he heard a cry like a little child’s: so he
followed the sound, till at last he looked up a high tree,
and on one of the branches sat a very little child. Now
its mother had fallen asleep, and a vulture had taken it
out of her lap and flown away with it, and left it on the
tree. Then the woodcutter climbed up, took the little
child down, and found it was a pretty little girl; and he
said to himself, “I will take this poor child home, and
bring her up with my own son Hansel.” So he brought
her to his cottage, and both grew up together: he called
the little girl Grethel, and the two children were so very
fond of each other that they were never happy but when
they were together.</p>

<p>But the woodcutter became very poor, and had nothing
in the world he could call his own; and indeed he had
scarcely bread enough for his wife and the two children<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">(130)</span>
to eat. At last the time came when even that was all
gone, and he knew not where to seek for help in his
need. Then at night, as he lay on his bed, and turned
himself here and there, restless and full of care, his wife
said to him, “Husband, listen to me, and take the two
children out early to-morrow morning; give each of them
a piece of bread, and then lead them into the midst of
the wood, where it is thickest, make a fire for them, and
go away and leave them alone to shift for themselves, for
we can no longer keep them here.” “No, wife,” said
the husband, “I cannot find it in my heart to leave the
children to the wild beasts of the forest; they would soon
tear them to pieces.” “Well, if you will not do as I
say,” answered the wife, “we must all starve together.”
And she would not let him have any peace until he came
into her hard-hearted plan.</p>

<p>Meantime the poor children too were lying awake restless,
and weak from hunger, so that they heard all that
Hansel’s mother said to her husband. “Now,” thought
Grethel to herself, “it is all up with us”: and she began
to weep. But Hansel crept to her bedside, and said,
“Do not be afraid, Grethel, I will find out some help
for us.” Then he got up, put on his jacket, and opened
the door and went out.</p>

<p>The moon shone bright upon the little court before
the cottage, and the white pebbles glittered like daisies
on the green meadows. So he stooped down, and put
as many as he could into his pocket, and then went back
to the house. “Now, Grethel,” said he, “rest in peace!”
and he went to bed and fell fast asleep.</p>

<p>Early in the morning, before the sun had risen, the
woodman’s wife came and awoke them. “Get up,
children,” said she, “we are going into the wood; there
is a piece of bread for each of you, but take care of it,
and keep some for the afternoon.” Grethel took the
bread, and carried it in her apron, because Hansel had
his pocket full of stones; and they made their way into
the wood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">(131)</span></p>

<figure class="figright illowp20" id="image131">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/image131.png"><img class="w100" src="images/image131_small.png" alt="" title="Lingering behind to drop one pebble after another along the road"></a>
</figure>

<p>After they had walked on for a time, Hansel stood still
and looked towards home; and after a
while he turned again, and so on several
times. Then his father said, “Hansel,
why do you keep turning and lagging
about so? <span id="cor131">Move</span> on a little faster.” “Ah,
father,” answered Hansel, “I am stopping
to look at my white
cat, that sits on the roof,
and wants to say good-bye
to me.” “You little
fool!” said his mother,
“that is not your cat;
it is the morning sun
shining on the chimney-top.”
Now Hansel had
not been looking at the
cat, but had all the while
been lingering behind,
to drop from his pocket
one white pebble after another
along the road.</p>

<p>When they came into the
midst of the wood the woodman
said, “Run about, children,
and pick up some wood,
and I will make a fire to keep
us all warm.” So they piled
up a little heap of brushwood,
and set it on fire; and as the
flames burnt bright, the mother
said, “Now set yourselves by
the fire, and go to sleep, while
we go and cut wood in the
forest; be sure you wait till we come again and fetch
you.” Hansel and Grethel sat by the fireside till the
afternoon, and then each of them ate their piece of bread.
They fancied the woodman was still in the wood, because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">(132)</span>
they thought they heard the blows of his axe; but it was
a bough, which he had cunningly hung upon a tree, in such
a way that the wind blew it backwards and forwards against
the other boughs: and so it sounded as the axe does in
cutting. Thus they waited till evening: but the woodman
and his wife kept away, and no one came to fetch them.</p>

<p>When it was quite dark Grethel began to cry; but then
Hansel said, “Wait awhile till the moon rises.” And
when the moon rose he took her by the hand, and there
lay the pebbles along the ground, glittering like new pieces
of money, and marking out the way. Towards morning
they came again to the woodman’s house, and he was glad
in his heart when he saw the children again, for he had
grieved at leaving them alone. His wife also seemed to
be glad; but in her heart she was angry at it.</p>

<p>Not long afterwards there was again no bread in the
house, and Hansel and Grethel heard the wife say to her
husband, “The children found their way back once, and
I took it in good part; but now there is only half a loaf
of bread left for them in the house; to-morrow you must
take them deeper into the wood, that they may not find
their way out, or we shall all be starved.” It grieved the
husband in his heart to do as his selfish wife wished, and
he thought it would be better to share their last morsel
with the children; but as he had done as she said once,
he did not dare now to say no. When the children heard
all their plan, Hansel got up, and wanted to pick up
pebbles as before; but when he came to the door, he
found his mother had locked it. Still he comforted
Grethel, and said, “Sleep in peace, dear Grethel! God
is very kind, and will help us.”</p>

<p>Early in the morning, a piece of bread was given to
each of them, but still smaller than the one they had
before. Upon the road Hansel crumbled his in his pocket
and often stood still, and threw a crumb upon the ground.
“Why do you lag so behind, Hansel?” said the woodman;
“go your ways on before.” “I am looking at my
little dove that is sitting upon the roof, and wants to say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">(133)</span>
good-bye to me.” “You silly boy!” said the wife, “that
is not your little dove; it is the morning sun, that shines
on the chimney-top.” But Hansel still went on crumbling
his bread, and throwing it on the ground. And thus they
went on still further into the wood, where they had never
been before in all their life.</p>

<p>There they were again told to sit down by a large fire,
and go to sleep; and the woodman and his wife said they
would come in the evening and fetch them away. In the
afternoon Hansel shared Grethel’s bread, because he had
strewed all his upon the road; but the day passed away,
and evening passed away too, and no one came to the
poor children. Still Hansel comforted Grethel, and said,
“Wait till the moon rises; and then I shall be able to see
the crumbs of bread which I have strewed, and they will
show us the way home.”</p>

<p>The moon rose; but when Hansel looked for the crumbs
they were gone, for hundreds of little birds in the wood
had found them and picked them up. Hansel, however,
set out to try and find his way home; but they soon lost
themselves in the wilderness, and went on through the
night and all the next day, till at last they laid down and
fell asleep for weariness. Another day they went on as
before, but still did not come to the end of the wood; and
they were as hungry as could be, for they had had nothing
to eat.</p>

<p>In the afternoon of the third day they came to a strange
little hut, made of bread, with a roof of cake, and windows
of barley-sugar. “Now we will sit down and eat till we
have had enough,” said Hansel; “I will eat off the roof
for my share; do you eat the windows, Grethel, they will
be nice and sweet for you.” Whilst Grethel, however, was
picking at the barley-sugar, a pretty voice called softly from
within,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Tip, tap! who goes there?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But the children answered,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“The wind, the wind,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That blows through the air!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">(134)</span></p>
<p class="noindent">and went on eating. Now Grethel had broken out a round
pane of the window for herself, and Hansel had torn off a
large piece of cake from the roof, when the door opened,
and a little old fairy came gliding out. At this Hansel and
Grethel were so frightened, that they let fall what they had
in their hands. But the old lady nodded to them, and
said, “Dear children, where have you been wandering about?
Come in with me; you shall have something good.”</p>

<p>So she took them each by the hand, and led them into
her little hut, and brought out plenty to eat,—milk and
pancakes, with sugar, apples, and nuts; and then two
beautiful little beds were got ready, and Grethel and
Hansel laid themselves down, and thought they were in
heaven. But the fairy was a spiteful one, and made her
pretty sweetmeat house to entrap little children. Early in
the morning, before they were awake, she went to their
little beds; and though she saw the two sleeping and looking
so sweetly, she had no pity on them, but was glad they
were in her power. Then she took up Hansel, and fastened
him up in a coop by himself, and when he awoke he found
himself behind a grating, shut up safely, as chickens are;
but she shook Grethel, and called out, “Get up, you lazy
little thing, and fetch some water; and go into the kitchen,
and cook something good to eat: your brother is shut up
yonder; I shall first fatten him, and when he is fat, I
think I shall eat him.”</p>

</figure>
</div>

<p>When the fairy was gone poor Grethel watched her
time, and got up, and ran to Hansel, and told him what
she had heard, and said, “We must run away quickly,
for the old woman is a bad fairy, and will kill us.” But
Hansel said, “You must first steal away her fairy wand,
that we may save ourselves if she should follow; and
bring the pipe too that hangs up in her room.” Then the
little maiden ran back, and fetched the magic wand and
the pipe, and away they went together; so when the old
fairy came back and could see no one at home, she sprang
in a great rage to the window, and looked out into the
wide world (which she could do far and near), and a long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">(137)</span>
way off she spied Grethel, running away with her
dear Hansel. “You are already a great way off,” said
she; “but you will still fall into my hands.”</p>

<div class="chapter fullpage">
<figure class="figcenter illowp40 fullpage" id="image137">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/image137.png"><img class="fullpage" src="images/image137_small.png" alt="" title="Fastened him up in a coop"></a>
</figure>
</div>

<p>Then she put on her boots, which walked several
miles at a step, and scarcely made two steps with them
before she overtook the
children; but Grethel saw
that the fairy was coming
after them, and, by the
help of the wand, turned
her friend Hansel into a
lake of water, and herself
into a swan, which swam
about in the middle of it.
So the fairy sat herself
down on the shore, and
took a great deal of trouble
to decoy the swan, and
threw crumbs of bread to
it; but it would not come
near her, and she was
forced to go home in the
evening without
taking her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">(138)</span>
revenge. Then Grethel changed herself and Hansel back
into their own forms once more, and they went journeying
on the whole night, until the dawn of day: and then the
maiden turned herself into a beautiful rose, that grew in
the midst of a quickset hedge; and Hansel sat by the
side.</p>

<p>The fairy soon came striding along. “Good piper,”
said she, “may I pluck yon beautiful rose for myself?”
“O yes,” answered he. “And then,” thought he to
himself, “I will play you a tune meantime.” So when
she had crept into the hedge in a great hurry, to gather
the flower—for she well knew what it was,—he pulled out
the pipe slily, and began to play. Now the pipe was a
fairy pipe, and, whether they liked it or not, whoever
heard it was obliged to dance. So the old fairy was forced
to dance a merry jig, on and on without any rest, and
without being able to reach the rose. And as he did not
cease playing a moment, the thorns at length tore the
clothes from off her body, and pricked her sorely, and
there she stuck quite fast.</p>

<p>Then Grethel set herself free once more, and on they
went; but she grew very tired, and Hansel said, “Now I
will hasten home for help.” And Grethel said, “I will
stay here in the meantime, and wait for you.” Then
Hansel went away, and Grethel was to wait for him.</p>

<p>But when Grethel had stayed in the field a long time,
and found he did not come back, she became quite
sorrowful, and turned herself into a little daisy, and thought
to herself, “Someone will come and tread me under foot,
and so my sorrows will end.” But it so happened that, as
a shepherd was keeping watch in a field, he saw the daisy;
and thinking it very pretty, he took it home, placed it in
a box in his room, and said, “I have never found so
pretty a daisy before.” From that time everything throve
wonderfully at the shepherd’s house. When he got up in
the morning, all the household work was ready done;
the room was swept and cleaned, the fire made, and the
water fetched; and in the afternoon, when he came home,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">(139)</span>
the table-cloth was laid, and a good dinner ready set for
him. He could not make out how all this happened, for
he saw no one in his house; and although it pleased him
well enough, he was at length troubled to think how it
could be, and went to a cunning woman who lived hard
by, and asked her what he should do. She said, “There
must be witchcraft in it; look out to-morrow morning
early, and see if anything stirs about in the room: if it
does, throw a white cloth at once over it, and then the
witchcraft will be stopped.” The shepherd did as she
said, and the next morning saw the box open, and the
daisy come out: then he sprang up quickly, and threw a
white cloth over it: in an instant the spell was broken,
and Grethel stood before him, for it was she who had
taken care of his house for him; and she was so beautiful,
that he asked her if she would marry him. She said,
“No,” because she wished to be faithful to her dear
Hansel; but she agreed to stay, and keep house for him
till Hansel came back.</p>

<p>Time passed on, and Hansel came back at last; for the
spiteful fairy had led him astray, and he had not been
able for a long time to find his way, either home or back
to Grethel. Then he and Grethel set out to go home;
but after travelling a long way, Grethel became tired, and
she and Hansel laid themselves down to sleep in a fine
old hollow tree that grew in a meadow by the side of
the wood. But as they slept the fairy—who had got out
of the bush at last—came by; and finding her wand was
glad to lay hold of it, and at once turned poor Hansel into
a fawn while he was asleep.</p>

<p>Soon after Grethel awoke, and found what had happened;
and she wept bitterly over the poor creature; and
the tears too rolled down his eyes, as he laid himself
down beside her. Then she said, “Rest in peace, dear
fawn; I will never, never leave thee.” So she took off her
golden necklace, and put it round his neck, and plucked
some rushes, and plaited them into a soft string to fasten
to it, and led the poor little thing by her side when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">(140)</span>
she went to walk in the wood; and when they were tired
they came back, and laid down to sleep by the side of the
hollow tree, where they lodged at night: but nobody came
near them except the little dwarfs that lived in the wood,
and these watched over them while they were asleep.</p>

<p>At last one day they came to a little cottage; and
Grethel having looked in, and seen that it was quite
empty, thought to herself, “We can stay and live here.”
Then she went and gathered leaves and moss to make a
soft bed for the fawn; and every morning she went out
and plucked nuts, roots, and berries for herself, and sweet
shrubs and tender grass for her friend; and it ate out of
her hand, and was pleased, and played and frisked about
her. In the evening, when Grethel was tired, and had
said her prayers, she laid her head upon the fawn for her
pillow, and slept; and if poor Hansel could but have his
right form again, she thought they should lead a very
happy life.</p>

<p>They lived thus a long while in the wood by themselves,
till it chanced that the king of that country came to hold a
great hunt there. And when the fawn heard all around
the echoing of the horns, and the baying of the dogs, and
the merry shouts of the huntsmen, he wished very much
to go and see what was going on. “Ah, sister! sister!”
said he, “let me go out into the wood, I can stay
no longer.” And he begged so long, that she at last
agreed to let him go. “But,” said she, “be sure to come
to me in the evening; I shall shut up the door, to keep
out those wild huntsmen; and if you tap at it and say,
‘Sister, let me in!’ I shall know you; but if you don’t
speak, I shall keep the door fast.” Then away sprang the
fawn, and frisked and bounded along in the open air.
The king and his huntsmen saw the beautiful creature,
and followed, but could not overtake him; for when they
thought they were sure of their prize, he sprang over the
bushes, and was out of sight at once.</p>

<p>As it grew dark he came running home to the hut and
tapped, and said, “Sister, sister, let me in!” Then she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">(141)</span>
opened the little door, and in he jumped, and slept soundly
all night on his soft bed.</p>

<p>Next morning the hunt began again; and when he
heard the huntsmen’s horns, he said, “Sister, open the
door for me, I must go again.” Then she let him out,
and said, “Come back in the evening, and remember what
you are to say.” When the king and the huntsmen saw
the fawn with the golden collar again, they gave him chase;
but he was too quick for them. The chase lasted the
whole day; but at last the huntsmen nearly surrounded
him, and one of them wounded him in the foot, so that
he became sadly lame, and could hardly crawl home. The
man who had wounded him followed close behind, and
hid himself, and heard the little fawn say, “Sister, sister,
let me in!” upon which the door opened, and soon shut
again. The huntsman marked all well, and went to the
king and told him what he had seen and heard; then the
king said, “To-morrow we will have another chase.”</p>

<p>Grethel was very much frightened when she saw that
her dear little fawn was wounded; but she washed the
blood away, and put some healing herbs on it, and said,
“Now go to bed, dear fawn, and you will soon be well
again.” The wound was so slight, that in the morning
there was nothing to be seen of it; and when the horn
blew, the little thing said, “I can’t stay here, I must go
and look on; I will take care that none of them shall
catch me.” But Grethel said, “I am sure they will kill
you this time: I will not let you go.” “I shall die of
grief,” said he, “if you keep me here; when I hear the
horns, I feel as if I could fly.” Then Grethel was forced
to let him go: so she opened the door with a heavy heart,
and he bounded out gaily into the wood.</p>

<p>When the king saw him, he said to his huntsmen, “Now
chase him all day long, till you catch him; but let none
of you do him any harm.” The sun set, however, without
their being able to overtake him, and the king called away
the huntsmen, and said to the one who had watched, “Now
come and show me the little hut.” So they went to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">(142)</span>
door and tapped, and said, “Sister, sister, let me in!”
Then the door opened, and the king went in, and there
stood a maiden more lovely than any he had ever seen.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp10" id="image142">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/image142.png"><img class="w100" src="images/image142_small.png" alt="" title="Tailpiece"></a>
</figure>

<p>Grethel was frightened to see that it was not
her fawn, but a king with a golden crown
that was come into her hut: however, he
spoke kindly to her, and took her hand, and
said, “Will you come with me to my castle,
and be my wife?” “Yes,” said the maiden,
“I will go to your castle, but I cannot be
your wife; and my fawn must go with
me, I cannot part with that.” “Well,”
said the king, “he shall come and live
with you all your life, and want for
nothing.” Just then in sprang the little
fawn; and his sister tied the string to his neck, and they
left the hut in the wood together.</p>

<p>Then the king took Grethel to his palace, and on the
way she told him all her story: and then he sent for the
fairy, and made her change the fawn into Hansel again;
and he and Grethel loved one another, and were married,
and lived happily together all their days in the good king’s
palace.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The story of Hansel and Grethel was liked as well as
any one that could be told and the German Fairy was very
proud of this, so much so that she began to declare that
the part of the world which she came from was one far
richer than any other in such stories, and implied that
she was quite ready to tell them all if King Oberon liked,
but the king did not take the hint but instead thanked
the German Fairy, and at once began to look around for
the next tale-teller when Puck came flying up and in a
privileged fashion whispered in the ear of the Fairy King.</p>

<p>“Capital,” exclaimed Oberon, “Bottom and his friends
must know some stories and one of them shall be next.”</p>

<p>Off Puck went, and then there was such a shuffling of
feet and nudging of elbows where Nick Bottom the weaver<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">(143)</span>
sat with Quince, Snug, Flute, Snout and Starveling, his
companions.</p>

<p>“You first, bully Bottom,” says Snout, and “You first,
Peter Quince,” says Nick Bottom, and “You first, Robin
Starveling,” “You first, Flute,” comes from the others.</p>

<p>Puck would not wait for the dispute as to precedence
to be settled but just laid hold of Robin Starveling the
tailor by the ear and willy-nilly off he had to go. On
getting to the stool, like a sensible fellow, he began
at once without any excuses by telling another story of
the Irish fairies, and his story was called</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="the_magic_bottle">The Magic Bottles</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It was in the good old days that
a farmer named Mick Purcell
rented a few acres of barren ground
in the neighbourhood of Mouren,
situated about three miles from
Mallow and thirteen from the
beautiful city called Cork. Mick had a
wife and family. They all did what they
could, and that was but little, for the poor man had no child
grown up big enough to help him in his work; and all the
poor woman could do was to mind the children, and to
milk the one cow, and to boil the potatoes and carry the
eggs to market to Mallow; but with all they could do
’twas hard enough on them to pay the rent. Well, they
did manage it for a good while; but at last came a bad
year, and the little grain of oats was all spoiled, and the
chickens died of the pip, and the pig got the measles—she
was sold in Mallow and brought almost nothing; and poor
Mick found that he hadn’t enough half to pay his rent.</p>

<p>“Why, then, Molly,” says he, “what’ll we do?”</p>

<p>“Wisha, then, mavourneen, what would you do but take
the cow to the fair of Cork and sell her?” says she; “and
so you must go to-morrow, that the poor beast may be
rested <em>again</em> the fair.”</p>

<p>“And what’ll we do when she’s gone?” says Mick
sorrowfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">(145)</span></p>

<p>“Never a know I know, Mick; but sure God won’t leave
us without him, Mick; and you know how good he was to
us when poor little Billy was sick, and we had nothing at
all for him to take—that good doctor gentleman at Ballydahin
came riding and asking for a drink of milk; and
how he gave us two shillings; and how he sent the
things and bottles for the child and gave me my breakfast
when I went over to ask a question, so he did; and how
he came to see Billy, and never left off his goodness till he
was quite well?”</p>

<p>“Oh! you are always that way, Molly, and I believe you
are right after all, so I won’t be sorry for selling the cow;
but I’ll go to-morrow, and you must put a needle and thread
through my coat, for you know ’tis ripped under the arm.”</p>

<p>Molly told him he should have everything right; and
about twelve o’clock next day he left her, getting a charge
not to sell his cow except for the highest penny. Mick
promised to mind it, and went his way along the road.
He drove his cow slowly through the little stream which
crosses it, and runs under the old walls of Mourne. As he
passed he glanced his eye upon the towers and one of the
old elder trees, which were then only little bits of switches.</p>

<p>“Oh, then, if I only had half the money that’s buried
in you, ’tisn’t driving this poor cow I’d be now! Why,
then, isn’t it too bad that it should be there covered over
with earth, and many a one besides me wanting? Well, if
it’s God’s will, I’ll have some money myself coming back.”</p>

<p>So saying he moved on after his beast. ’Twas a fine
day, and the sun shone brightly on the walls of the old
abbey as he passed under them. He then crossed an
extensive mountain tract and after six long miles he came
to the top of that hill—Bottle Hill ’tis called now, but
that was not the name of it then, and just there a man overtook
him. “Good morrow,” says he. “Good morrow,
kindly,” says Mick, looking at the stranger, who was a little
man, you’d almost call him a dwarf, only he wasn’t quite so
little neither: he had a bit of an old wrinkled, yellow face,
for all the world like a dried cauliflower only he had a sharp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">(146)</span>
little nose, and red eyes, and white hair, and his lips were
not red, but all his face was one colour, and his eyes were
never quite still but looking at everything and although
they were red they made Mick feel quite cold when he
looked at them. In truth he did not much like the little
man’s company; and he couldn’t see one bit of his legs nor
his body, for though the day was warm, he was all wrapped
up in a big great-coat. Mick drove his cow something
faster, but the little man kept up with him. Mick didn’t
know how he walked for he was almost afraid to look at him,
and to cross himself, for fear the old man would be angry.
Yet he thought his fellow-traveller did not seem to walk
like other men, nor to put one foot before the other, but
to glide over the rough road—and rough enough it was—like
a shadow, without noise and without effort. Mick’s
heart trembled within him, and he said a prayer to himself,
wishing he hadn’t come out that day, or that he was on
Fair-hill, or that he hadn’t the cow to mind that he might
run away from the bad thing—when, in the midst of his
fears, he was again addressed by his companion.</p>

<p>“Where are you going with the cow, honest man?”</p>

<p>“To the fair of Cork then,” says Mick, trembling at
the shrill and piercing tones of the voice.</p>

<p>“Are you going to sell her?” said the stranger.</p>

<p>“Why, then, what else am I going for but to sell her?”</p>

<p>“Will you sell her to me?”</p>

<p>Mick started—he was afraid to have anything to do with
the little man, and he was more afraid to say no.</p>

<p>“What’ll you give for her?” at last says he.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what, I’ll give you this bottle,” said the
little one, pulling a bottle from under his coat.</p>

<p>Mick looked at him and the bottle, and, in spite of his
terror, he could not help bursting into a loud fit of
laughter.</p>

<p>“Laugh if you will,” said the little man, “but I tell you
this bottle is better for you than all the money you will get
for the cow in Cork—ay, than ten thousand times as
much.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">(147)</span></p>

<p>Mick laughed again. “Why then,” says he, “do you
think I am such a fool as to give my good cow for a bottle—and
an empty one, too? indeed, then I won’t.”</p>

<p>“You’d better give me the cow, and take the bottle—you’ll
not be sorry for it.”</p>

<p>“Why, then, and what would Molly say? I’d never hear
the end of it; and how would I pay the rent? and what
would we all do without a penny of money?”</p>

<p>“I tell you this bottle is better to you than money; take
it and give me the cow. I ask you for the last time, Mick
Purcell.”</p>

<p>Mick started.</p>

<p>“How does he know my name?” thought he.</p>

<p>The stranger proceeded: “Mick Purcell, I know you,
and I have a regard for you; therefore do as I warn you,
or you may be sorry for it. How do you know but your
cow will die before you go to Cork?”</p>

<p>Mick was going to say “God forbid!” but the little
man went on (and he was too attentive to say anything to
stop him; for Mick was a very civil man, and he knew
better than to interrupt a gentleman, and that’s what many
people, that hold their heads higher, don’t mind now).</p>

<p>“And how do you know but there will be much cattle
at the fair, and you will get a bad price, or maybe you
might be robbed when you are coming home? but what
need I talk more to you, when you are determined to
throw away your luck, Mick Purcell.”</p>

<p>“Oh! no, I would not throw away my luck, sir,” said
Mick, “and if I was sure the bottle was as good as you
say, though I never liked an empty bottle, although I had
drank the contents of it, I’d give you the cow in the
name——”</p>

<p>“Never mind names,” said the stranger, “but give me
the cow; I would not tell you a lie. Here, take the
bottle, and when you go home do what I direct exactly.”</p>

<p>Mick hesitated.</p>

<p>“Well, then, good-bye, I can stay no longer: once more
take it, and be rich; refuse it, and beg for your life, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">(148)</span>
see your children in poverty, and your wife dying for want—that
will happen to you, Mick Purcell!” said the little
man with a malicious grin, which made him look ten times
more ugly than ever.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp40" id="image148">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/image148.png"><img class="w100" src="images/image148_small.png" alt="" title="“Here take the bottle”"></a>
</figure>

<p>“Maybe, ’tis true,” said Mick, still hesitating: he did
not know what to do—he could hardly help believing the
old man, and at length in a fit of desperation, he seized
the bottle. “Take the cow,” said he, “and if you are
telling a lie, the curse of the poor will be on you.”</p>

<p>“I care neither for your curses nor your blessings; but
I have spoken truth, Mick Purcell, and that you will find
to-night, if you do what I tell you.”</p>

<p>“And what’s that?” says Mick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">(149)</span></p>

<figure class="figright illowp20" id="image149">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/image149.png"><img class="w100" src="images/image149_small.png" alt="" title="Mick went home muttering prayers and holding fast the bottle"></a>
</figure>

<p>“When you go home, never mind if your wife is angry,
but be quiet yourself, and make her sweep the room clean,
set the table out right and spread a clean cloth over it;
then put the bottle on
the ground saying these
words: ‘Bottle, do your
duty,’ and you will see
the end of it.”</p>

<p>“And is this all?” says
Mick.</p>

<p>“No more,” said the
stranger. “Good-bye,
Mick Purcell—you are
a rich man.”</p>

<p>“God grant it!” said
Mick, as the old man
moved after the cow, and
Mick retraced the road
towards his cabin; but
he could not help turning
back his head, to look
after the purchaser of his
cow, who was nowhere to
be seen.</p>

<p>“Lord between us and
harm!” said Mick. “<em>He</em>
can’t belong to this earth;
but where is the cow?”
She, too, was gone, and
Mick went homeward
muttering prayers, and
holding fast the bottle.</p>

<p>“And what would I do if it broke?” thought he.
“Oh! but I’ll take care of that.” So he put it into his
bosom, and went on anxious to prove his bottle, and
doubting of the reception he should meet from his wife.
Balancing his anxieties with his expectation, his fears
with his hopes, he reached home in the evening and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">(150)</span>
surprised his wife, sitting over the turf fire in the big
chimney.</p>

<p>“Oh! Mick, are you come back? Sure you weren’t at
Cork all the way! What has happened to you? Where is
the cow? Did you sell her? How much money did you
get for her? What news have you? Tell us everything
about it.”</p>

<p>“Why then, Molly, if you’ll give me time, I’ll tell you
all about it. If you want to know where the cow is, ’tisn’t
Mick can tell you, for the never a know does he know
where she is now.”</p>

<p>“Oh! then, you sold her; and where’s the money?”</p>

<p>“Arrah, stop awhile, Molly, and I’ll tell you all about
it.”</p>

<p>“But what is that bottle under your waistcoat?” said
Molly, spying its neck sticking out.</p>

<p>“Why, then, be easy now, can’t you,” says Mick, “till
I tell it to you.” Then, putting the bottle on the table,
“That’s all I got for the cow.”</p>

<p>His poor wife was thunderstruck. “All you got! and
what good is that, Mick? Oh! I never thought you were
such a fool; and what’ll we do for the rent, and what——”</p>

<p>“Now, Molly,” says Mick, “can’t you hearken to reason?
Didn’t I tell you how the old man, or whatsoever he was,
met me—no, he did not meet me, neither, but he was
there with me—on the big hill and how he made me sell
him the cow, and told me the bottle was the only thing
for me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, the only thing for you, you fool!” said
Molly seizing the bottle to hurl it at her poor husband’s
head; but Mick caught it, and quickly (for he minded the
old man’s advice) loosened his wife’s grasp, and placed the
bottle again in his bosom. Poor Molly sat down crying,
while Mick told her his story, with many a crossing and
blessing between him and harm. His wife could not help
believing him, particularly as she had as much faith in
fairies as she had in the priest, who indeed never discouraged
her belief in the fairies; maybe he didn’t know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">(151)</span>
she believed in them, and maybe he believed in them
himself. She got up, however, without saying one word,
and began to sweep the earthen floor with a bunch of
heath; then she tidied up everything, and put out the long
table, and spread the clean cloth, for she had only one,
upon it, and Mick, placing the bottle on the ground, looked
at it and said, “Bottle, do your duty.”</p>

<p>“Look there! look there, mammy!” said his chubby
eldest son, a boy about five years old—“look there! look
there!” and he sprung to his mother’s side, as two tiny
little fellows rose like light from the bottle, and in an
instant covered the table with dishes and plates of gold
and silver, full of the finest victuals that ever were seen,
and when all was done went into the bottle again. Mick
and his wife looked at everything with astonishment; they
had never seen such plates and dishes before, and didn’t
think they could ever admire them enough, the very sight
almost took away their appetites; but at length Molly said,
“Come and sit down, Mick, and try and eat a bit: sure
you ought to be hungry after such a good day’s work.”</p>

<p>“Why, then, the man told no lie about the bottle.”</p>

<p>Mick sat down, after putting the children to the table
and they made a hearty meal, though they couldn’t taste
half the dishes.</p>

<p>“Now,” says Molly, “I wonder will those two good
little gentlemen carry away these fine things again?”
They waited, but no one came; so Molly put up the dishes
and plates very carefully saying, “Why, then, Mick, that
was no lie sure enough: but you’ll be a rich man yet, Mick
Purcell.”</p>

<p>Mick and his wife and children went to their bed, not
to sleep, but to settle about selling the fine things they
did not want and taking more land. Mick went to Cork
and sold his plate, and bought a horse and cart, and began
to show that he was making money; and they did all they
could to keep the bottle a secret; but for all that, their landlord
found it out, for he came to Mick one day and asked him
where he got all his money—sure it was not by the farm;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">(152)</span>
and he bothered him so much, that at last Mick told him
of the bottle. His landlord offered him a deal of money
for it, but Mick would not give it, till at last he offered to
give him all his farm for ever: so Mick, who was very rich,
thought he’d never want any more money, and gave him
the bottle: but Mick was mistaken—he and his family
spent money as if there was no end of it; and to make
the story short, they became poorer and poorer, till at last
they had nothing left but one cow; and Mick once more
drove his cow before him to sell her at Cork fair, hoping
to meet the old man and get another bottle. It was hardly
daybreak when he left home, and he walked on at a good
pace till he reached the big hill: the mists were sleeping in
the valleys and curling like smoke wreaths upon the brown
heath around him. The sun rose on his left, and just at
his feet a lark sprang from its grassy couch and poured
forth its joyous matin song, ascending into the clear blue
sky.</p>

<p>Mick crossed himself listening as he advanced to the
sweet song of the lark, but thinking, notwithstanding, all
the time of the little old man; when, just as he reached
the summit of the hill, and cast his eyes over the extensive
prospect before and around him, he was startled and
rejoiced by the same well-known voice: “Well, Mick
Purcell, I told you you would be a rich man.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, then, sure enough I was, that’s no lie for you,
sir. Good morning to you, but it is not rich I am now—but
have you another bottle, for I want it now as much as
I did long ago; so if you have it, sir, here is the cow for it.”</p>

<p>“And here is the bottle,” said the old man, smiling;
“you know what to do with it.”</p>

<p>“Oh! then, sure I do, as good right I have.”</p>

<p>“Well, farewell for ever, Mick Purcell: I told you you
would be a rich man.”</p>

<p>“And good-bye to you, sir,” said Mick, as he turned
back; “and good luck to you, and good luck to the big hill—it
wants a name—Bottle Hill—good-bye, sir, good-bye.”</p>

<p>Mick walked home as fast as he could, never looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">(155)</span>
after the white-faced little gentleman and the cow, so anxious
was he to bring home the bottle. Well, he arrived with it
safely enough, and called out as soon as he saw Molly—“Oh!
sure I’ve another bottle!”</p>

</figure>
</div>

<p>“Arrah! then, have you? why, then, you’re a lucky man,
Mick Purcell, that’s what you are.”</p>

<p>In an instant she put everything right; and Mick, looking
at his bottle, exultingly cried out, “Bottle, do your duty.”
In a twinkling, two great stout men with big cudgels issued
from the bottle (I do not know how they got room in it) and
belaboured poor Mick and his wife and all his family, till
they lay on the floor, when in they went again. Mick, as
soon as he recovered, got up and looked about him; he
thought and thought, and at last he took up his wife and
his children; and, leaving them to recover as well as they
could, he took the bottle under his coat and went to his
landlord, who had a great company: he got a servant to
tell him he wanted to speak to him, and at last he came
out to Mick.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you want now?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, sir, only I have another bottle.”</p>

<p>“Oh! ho! is it as good as the first?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, and better; if you like, I will show it to you
before all the ladies and gentlemen.”</p>

<p>“Come along, then.” So saying Mick was brought into
the great hall, where he saw his old bottle standing high up
on a shelf. “Ah! ha!” says he to himself, “maybe I won’t
have you by-and-by.”</p>

<p>“Now,” says his landlord, “show us your bottle.” Mick
set it on the floor, and uttered the words: in a moment the
landlord was tumbled on the floor; ladies and gentlemen,
servants and all, were running, and roaring, and sprawling,
and kicking, and shrieking. Wine cups and salvers were
knocked about in every direction, until the landlord called
out, “Stop those two devils, Mick Purcell, or I’ll have you
hanged.”</p>

<p>“They never shall stop,” said Mick, “till I get my own
bottle that I see up there at top of that shelf.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">(156)</span></p>

<p>“Get it down to him, give it down to him, before we are
all killed!” says the landlord.</p>

</figure>

<p>Mick put his bottle in his bosom: in jumped the two
men into the new bottle, and he carried
them home. I need not lengthen my story
by telling how they got richer than ever;
how his son married his landlord’s only
daughter, how he and his wife died when
they were very old, and how some of the
servants fighting at their wake, broke the
bottles; but still the hill has the name
upon it; ay, and so ’twill be always Bottle
Hill to the end of the world, and so it
ought, for it is a strange story.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Some of the fairies did not think the
story so strange as Starveling the tailor did,
but then they were accustomed to wonderful
things. While he was making his way back
to his friends (with Puck keeping
close watch upon him the
while) the King had already
fixed upon the next tale-teller,
and a French Fay—a brilliant
delicate little creature with
transparent gauzy wings coloured
like the rainbow—was
standing on the stool and had
begun to tell the story of the</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="princess_rosette">Princess Rosette</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Once upon a time there lived a King and Queen who had
two handsome boys; so well-fed and hearty were they,
that they grew like the day.</p>

<p>Whenever the Queen had a child, she sent for the
fairies, that she might learn from them what would be its
future lot. After a while she had a little daughter, who
was so beautiful, that no one could see her without loving
her. The fairies came as usual, and the Queen having
feasted them, said to them as they were going away, “Do
not forget that good custom of yours, but tell me what will
happen to Rosette”—for this was the name of the little
Princess. The fairies answered her that they had left their
divining-books at home, and that they would come again
to see her. “Ah!” said the Queen, “that bodes no good,
I fear; you do not wish to distress me by foretelling evil;
but, I pray you, let me know the worst, and hide nothing
from me.” The fairies continued to make excuses, but the
Queen only became more anxious to know the truth. At last
the chief among them said to her, “We fear, madam, that
Rosette will be the cause of a great misfortune befalling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">(158)</span>
her brothers; that they may even lose their lives on her
account. This is all that we can tell you of the fate of
this sweet little Princess, and we are grieved to have
nothing better to say about her.” The fairies took their
departure, and the Queen was very sorrowful, so sorrowful
that the King saw by her face that she was in trouble.
He asked her what was the matter. She told him she had
gone too near the fire and accidentally burnt all the flax
that was on her distaff. “Is that all?” replied the King,
and he went up to his store-room and brought her down
more flax than she could spin in a hundred years.</p>

<p>But the Queen was still very sorrowful, and the King
again asked her what was the matter. She told him that
she had been down to the river and had let one of her
green satin slippers fall into the water. “Is that all?”
replied the King, and he sent for all the shoemakers in the
kingdom, and made the Queen a present of ten thousand
green satin slippers.</p>

<p>Still the Queen was no less sorrowful; and the King
asked her once more what was the matter. She told
him that, being hungry, she had eaten hastily, and had
swallowed her wedding-ring. The King knew that she
was not speaking the truth, for he had himself put away
the ring, and he replied, “My dear wife, you are not
speaking the truth; here is your ring, which I have kept in
my purse.” The Queen was put out of countenance at
being caught telling a lie—for there is nothing in the
world so ugly—and she saw that the King was vexed, so
she told him what the fairies had predicted about little
Rosette, and begged him to tell her if he could think of
any remedy. The King was greatly troubled, so much so,
that at last he said to the Queen, “I see no way of saving
our two boys, except by putting the little girl to death,
while she is still in her swaddling clothes.” But the
Queen cried that she would rather suffer death herself,
that she would never consent to so cruel a deed, and that
the King must try and think of some other remedy. The
King and Queen could think of nothing else, and while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">(159)</span>
thus pondering over the matter, the Queen was told that
in a large wood near the town, there lived an old hermit,
who made his home in the trunk of a tree, whom people
went from far and near to consult.</p>

<p>“It is to him I must go,” said the Queen; “the fairies
told me the evil, but they forgot to tell me the remedy.”</p>

<p>She started early in the morning, mounted on her little
white mule, that was shod with gold, and accompanied by
two of her maids of honour, who each rode a pretty horse.
When they were near the wood they dismounted out of
respect, and made their way to the tree where the hermit
lived. He did not much care for the visits of women, but
when he saw that it was the Queen approaching, he said,
“Welcome! what would you ask of me?” She related to
him what the fairies had said about Rosette, and asked
him to advise her what to do. He told her that the
Princess must be shut up in a tower, and not be allowed
to leave it as long as she lived. The Queen thanked him,
and returned and told everything to the King. The King
immediately gave orders for a large tower to be built as
quickly as possible. In it he placed his daughter, but
that she might not feel lonely and depressed, he, and the
Queen, and her two brothers, went to see her every day.
The elder of these was called the big Prince, and the
younger, the little Prince. They loved their sister passionately,
for she was the most beautiful and graceful Princess
ever seen, and the least glance of hers was worth more
than a hundred gold pieces. When she was fifteen years
old, the big Prince said to the King, “Father, my sister is
old enough to be married; shall we not soon have a
wedding?” The little Prince said the same to the Queen,
but their Majesties laughed and changed the subject, and
made no answer about the marriage.</p>

<p>Now, it happened that the King and Queen both fell
very ill, and died within a few days of one another. There
was great mourning; everyone wore black, and all the bells
were tolled. Rosette was inconsolable at the loss of her
good mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">(160)</span></p>

<p>As soon as the funeral was over, the dukes and
marquises of the kingdom placed the big Prince on a
throne made of gold and diamonds; he wore a splendid
crown on his head, and robes of violet velvet embroidered
with suns and moons. Then the whole Court cried out,
“Long live the King!” and now on all sides there was
nothing but rejoicing.</p>

<p>Then the young King and his brother said, “Now
that we are the masters, we will release our sister from
the tower, where she has been shut up for such a long
and dreary time.” They had only to pass through the
garden to reach the tower, which stood in one corner of
it, and had been built as high as was possible, for the
late Queen had intended her to remain there always.
Rosette was embroidering a beautiful dress on a frame in
front of her, when she saw her brothers enter. She rose,
and taking the King’s hand, said, “Good-day, sire, you are
now King, and I am your humble subject; I pray you to
release me from this tower, where I lead a melancholy
life,” and with this, she burst into tears. The King
embraced her, and begged her not to weep, for he was
come, he said, to take her from the tower, and to conduct
her to a beautiful castle. The Prince had his pockets full
of sweetmeats, which he gave Rosette. “Come,” he said,
“let us get away from this wretched place; the King will
soon find you a husband; do not be unhappy any longer.”</p>

<p>When Rosette saw the beautiful garden, full of flowers,
and fruits, and fountains, she was so overcome with
astonishment, that she stood speechless, for she had
never seen anything of the kind before. She looked
around her, she went first here, then there, she picked
the fruit off the trees, and gathered flowers from the beds;
while her little dog, Fretillon, who was as green as a
parrot, kept on running before her, saying, yap, yap, yap!
and jumping and cutting a thousand capers, and everybody
was amused at his ways. Presently he ran into a
little wood, whither the Princess followed him, and here
her wonder was even greater than before, when she saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">(161)</span>
a large peacock spreading out its tail. She thought it
so beautiful, so very beautiful, that she could not take
her eyes off it. The King and the Prince now joined
her, and asked her what delighted her so much. She
pointed to the peacock, and asked them what it was.
They told her it was a bird, which was sometimes eaten.
“What!” she cried, “dare to kill and eat a beautiful
bird like that<span id="cor161">.</span> I tell you, that I will marry no one but
the King of the Peacocks, and when I am their Queen
I shall not allow anybody to eat them.” The astonishment
of the King cannot be described. “But, dear
sister,” said he, “where would you have us go to find
the King of the Peacocks?” “Whither you please, sire;
but him, and him alone, will I marry.”</p>

<p>Having come to this decision, she was now conducted
by her brothers to their castle; the peacock had to be
brought and put into her room, so fond was she of it.
All the Court ladies who had not before seen Rosette
now hastened to greet her, and pay their respects to her.
Some brought preserves with them, some sugar, and
others dresses of woven gold, beautiful ribbons, dolls,
embroidered shoes, pearls, and diamonds. Everyone
did their best to entertain her, and she was so well
brought up, so courteous, kissing their hands, curtseying
when anything beautiful was given to her, that there
was not a lord or lady who did not leave her presence
gratified and charmed. While she was thus occupied,
the King and the Prince were turning over in their minds
how they should find the King of the Peacocks, if there
was such a person in the world to be found. They
decided that they would have Rosette’s portrait painted;
and when completed it was so life-like, that only speech
was wanting. Then they said to her, “Since you will
marry no one but the King of the Peacocks, we are
going together to look for him, and will traverse the
whole world to try and find him for you. If we find
him, we shall be very glad. Meanwhile take care of
our kingdom until we return.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">(162)</span></p>

<p>Rosette thanked them for all the trouble they were
taking; she promised to govern the kingdom well, and
said that, during their absence, her only pleasure would
be in looking at the peacock, and making her little dog
dance. They all three cried when they said good-bye
to each other.</p>

<p>So the two Princes started on their long journey, and
they asked everyone whom they met, “Do you know
the King of the Peacocks?” but the reply was always
the same, “No, we do not.” Each time they passed on
and went further, and in this way they travelled so very,
very far, that no one had ever been so far before.</p>

<p>They came to the kingdom of the <span id="cor162">cockchafers</span>; and
these were in such numbers, and made such a loud
buzzing, that the King feared he should become deaf.
He asked one of them, who appeared to him to have
the most intelligence, whether he knew where the King
of the Peacocks was to be found. “Sire,” replied the
<span id="cor162a">cockchafer</span>, “his kingdom lies thirty thousand leagues
from here; you have chosen the longest way to reach
it.” “And how do you know that?” asked the King.
“Because,” answered the <span id="cor162b">cockchafer</span>, “we know you very
well, for every year we spend two or three months in
your gardens.” Whereupon the King and his brother
embraced the <span id="cor162c">cockchafer</span>, and they went off arm in arm
to dine together, and the two strangers admired all the
curiosities of that new country, where the smallest leaf
of a tree was worth a gold piece. After that, they continued
their journey, and having been directed along the
right way, they were not long in reaching its close. On
their arrival, they found all the trees laden with peacocks,
and, indeed, there were peacocks everywhere, so that
they could be heard talking and screaming two leagues off.</p>

<p>The King said to his brother, “If the King of the
Peacocks is a peacock himself, how can our sister marry
him? it would be folly to consent to such a thing, and
it would be a fine thing for us to have little peacocks for
nephews.” The Prince was equally disturbed at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">(163)</span>
thought. “It is an unhappy fancy she has taken into
her head,” he said. “I cannot think what led her to
imagine that there was such a person in the world as
the King of the Peacocks.”</p>

<p>When they entered the town, they saw that it was full
of men and women, and that they all wore clothes made
of peacocks’ feathers, and that these were evidently considered
fine things, for every place was covered with them.
They met the King, who was driving in a beautiful little
carriage of gold, studded with diamonds, and drawn by
twelve peacocks at full gallop. This King of the Peacocks
was so handsome, that the King and the Prince
were delighted; he had long, light, curly hair, fair complexion,
and wore a crown of peacocks’ feathers. Directly
he saw them, he guessed, seeing that they wore a different
costume to the people of the country, that they were
strangers, and wishing to ascertain if this was so, he
ordered his carriage to stop, and sent for them.</p>

<p>The King and the Prince advanced, bowing low, and
said, “Sire, we have come from afar, to show you a
portrait.” They drew forth Rosette’s portrait and showed
it to him. After gazing at it a while, the King of the
Peacocks said, “I can scarcely believe that there is so
beautiful a maiden in the whole world.” “She is a
thousand times more beautiful,” said the King. “You
are jesting,” replied the King of the Peacocks. “Sire,”
rejoined the Prince, “here is my brother, who is a King,
like yourself; he is called King, and my name is Prince;
our sister, of whom this is the portrait, is the Princess
Rosette. We have come to ask if you will marry her;
she is good and beautiful, and we will give her, as dower,
a bushel of golden crowns.” “It is well,” said the King.
“I will gladly marry her; she shall want for nothing, and
I shall love her greatly; but I require that she shall be
as beautiful as her portrait, and if she is in the smallest
degree less so, I shall make you pay for it with your lives.”
“We consent willingly,” said both Rosette’s brothers.
“You consent?” added the King. “You will go to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">(164)</span>
prison then, and remain there until the Princess arrives.”
The Princes made no difficulty about this, for they knew
well that Rosette was more beautiful than her portrait.
They were well looked after while in prison, and were well
served with all they required, and the King often went to
see them. He kept Rosette’s portrait in his room, and
could scarcely rest day or night for looking at it. As the
King and his brother could not go to her themselves, they
wrote to Rosette, telling her to pack up as quickly as
possible, and to start without delay, as the King of the
Peacocks was awaiting her. They did not tell her that
they were prisoners, for fear of causing her uneasiness.</p>

<p>The Princess scarcely knew how to contain herself with
joy, when she received this message. She told everybody
that the King of the Peacocks had been found, and that
he wanted to marry her. Bonfires were lit, and guns fired,
and quantities of sweetmeats and sugar were eaten; everyone
who came to see the Princess, during the three days
before her departure, was given bread-and-butter and jam,
rolled wafers, and negus. After having thus dispensed
hospitality to her visitors, she presented her beautiful
dolls to her best friends, and handed over the government
to the wisest elders of the town, begging them to look well
after everything, to spend little, and to save up money for
the King on his return. She also prayed them to take
care of her peacock, for with her she only took her nurse,
and her foster-sister, and her little green dog, Fretillon.
They set out in a boat on the sea, carrying with them the
bushel of golden crowns, and sufficient clothes for two
changes a day for ten years. They made merry on their
voyage, laughing and singing, and the nurse kept on asking
the boatman if they were nearing the Kingdom of the
Peacocks; for a long time, all he said was, “No, no, not
yet.” Then at last, when she asked again, “Are we anywhere
near it now?” he answered, “We shall soon be
there, very soon.” Once more she said, “Are we near,
are we anywhere near it now?” and he said, “Yes, we are
now within reach of shore.” On hearing this, the nurse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">(165)</span>
went to the end of the boat, and sitting down beside the
boatman, said to him, “If you like, you can be rich for
the remainder of your life.” He replied, “I should like
nothing better.” She continued, “If you like, you can
earn good money.” “That would suit me very well,” he
answered. “Well,” she went on, “then to-night, when the
Princess is asleep, you must help me throw her into the
sea. After she is drowned, I will dress my daughter in
her fine clothes, and we will take her to the King of the
Peacocks, who will only be too pleased to marry her; and
as a reward to you, we will give you as many diamonds as
you care to possess.” The boatman was very much
astonished at this proposal; he told the nurse that it was
a pity to drown such a pretty Princess, and that he felt
compassion for her; but the nurse fetched a bottle of wine
and made him drink so much, that he had no longer any
power to refuse.</p>

<p>Night having come, the Princess went to bed as usual,
her little Fretillon lying at her feet, not even stirring one
of his paws. Rosette slept soundly, but the wicked nurse
kept awake, and went presently to fetch the boatman. She
took him into the Princess’s room, and together they lifted
her up, feather bed, mattress, sheets, coverlet, and all, and
threw them into the sea, the Princess all the while so fast
asleep, that she never woke. But fortunately, her bed was
made of Phœnix-feathers, which are extremely rare, and have
the property of always floating on water; so that she was
carried along in her bed as in a boat. The water, however,
began gradually first to wet her feather bed, then her
mattress, and Rosette began to feel uncomfortable, and
turned from side to side, and then Fretillon woke up. He
had a capital nose, and when he smelt the soles and codfish
so near, he started barking at them, and this awoke all
the other fish, who began swimming about. The bigger
ones ran against the Princess’s bed, which, not being
attached to anything, span round and round like a whirligig.
Rosette could not make out what was happening.
“Is our boat having a dance on the water?” she said.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">(166)</span>
“I am not accustomed to feeling so uneasy as I am
to-night,” and all the while Fretillon continued barking,
and going on as if he was out of his mind. The wicked
nurse and the boatman heard him from afar, and said:
“There’s that funny little beast drinking our healths with
his mistress. Let us make haste to land,” for they were
now just opposite the town of the King of the Peacocks.</p>

<p>He had sent down a hundred chariots to the landing-place;
they were drawn by all kinds of rare animals, lions,
bears, stags, wolves, horses, oxen, asses, eagles, and peacocks:
and the chariot which was intended for the Princess
was harnessed with six blue monkeys, that could jump,
dance on the tight rope, and do endless clever tricks; they
had beautiful trappings of crimson velvet, overlaid with
plates of gold. Sixty young maids of honour were also
in attendance, who had been chosen by the King for the
amusement of the Princess; they were dressed in all sorts
of colours, and gold and silver were the least precious of
their adornments.</p>

<p>The nurse had taken great pains to dress her daughter
finely; she had put on her Rosette’s best robe, and
decked her all over from head to foot with the Princess’s
diamonds; but with all this, she was still as ugly as an ape,
with greasy black hair, crooked eyes, bowed legs, and a
hump on her back; and, added to these deformities, she
was besides of a disagreeable and sulky temper, and was
always grumbling.</p>

<p>When the people saw her get out of the boat, they were
so taken aback by her appearance, that they could not
utter a sound. “What is the meaning of this?” she said.
“Are you all asleep? Be off, and bring me something to
eat! A nice set of beggars you are! I will have you all
hanged.” When they heard this, they murmured, “What
an ugly creature! and she is as wicked as she is ugly! A
nice wife for our King; well, we are not surprised! but
it was scarcely worth the trouble to bring her from the
other side of the world.” Meanwhile she still behaved
as if she were already mistress of all and everything, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">(171)</span>
for no reason at all, boxed their ears, or gave a blow with
her fist to everybody in turn.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp80" id="image168">

</figure>

<p>As her escort was a very large one, the procession moved
slowly, and she sat up in her chariot like a queen; but all
the peacocks, who had stationed themselves on the trees,
so as to salute her as she passed, and who had been prepared
to shout, “Long live the beautiful Queen Rosette!”
could only call out, “Fie, fie, how ugly she is!” as soon
as they caught sight of her. She was so enraged at this,
that she called to her guards, “Kill those rascally peacocks
who are insulting me.” But the peacocks quickly flew
away, and only laughed at her.</p>

<p>The treacherous boatman, seeing and hearing all this,
said in a low voice to the nurse, “There is something
wrong, good mother; your daughter should have been
better looking.” She answered, “Hold your tongue,
stupid, or you will bring us into trouble.”</p>

<p>The King had word brought him that the Princess was
approaching. “Well,” he said, “have her brothers, I
wonder, told me the truth? Is she more beautiful than
her portrait?” “Sire,” said those near him, “there will
be nothing to wish for, if she is as beautiful.” “You are
right,” replied the King, “I shall be well content with that.
Come, let us go and see her,” for he knew by the hubbub
in the courtyard that she had arrived. He could not
distinguish anything that was said, except, “Fie, fie, how
ugly she is!” and he imagined that the people were calling
out about some little dwarf or animal that she had brought
with her, for it never entered his head that the words were
applied to the Princess herself.</p>

<p>Rosette’s portrait was carried uncovered, at the top of a
long pole, and the King walked after it in solemn state, with
all his nobles and his peacocks, followed by ambassadors
from various kingdoms. The King of the Peacocks was
very impatient to see his dear Rosette; but when he did
see her—well, he very nearly died on the spot. He flew
into a violent rage, he tore his clothes, he would not go
near her, he felt quite afraid of her. “What!” he cried,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">(172)</span>
“have those two villains I have in prison had the boldness
and impudence to make a laughing-stock of me, and to
propose my marrying such a fright as that? They shall
both be killed; and let that insolent woman, and the
nurse, and the man who is with them, be immediately
carried to the dungeon of my great tower, and there kept.”
While this was going on, the King and his brother, who
knew that his sister was expected, had put on their bravest
apparel ready to receive her; but instead of seeing their
prison door open and being set at liberty, as they had
hoped, the gaoler came with a body of soldiers and made
them go down into a dark cellar, full of horrible reptiles,
and where the water was up to their necks; no one was
ever more surprised or distressed than they were. “Alas!”
they said to one another, “this is indeed a melancholy
marriage feast for us! What can have happened that we
should be so ill-treated?” They did not know what in
the world to think, except that they were to be killed, and
they were very sorrowful about this. Three days passed,
and no news reached them of any kind. At the end
of that time, the King of the Peacocks came, and began
calling out insulting things to them through a hole in the
wall. “You called yourselves King and Prince, that I
might fall into your trap, and engage myself to marry
your sister; but you are nothing better than two beggars,
who are not worth the water you drink. I am going to
bring you before the judges, who will soon pass their
verdict upon you; the rope to hang you with is already
being made.” “King of the Peacocks,” replied the King,
angrily, “do not act too rashly in this matter, or you
may repent it. I am a King as well as you, and I have
a fine kingdom, and rich clothing, and crowns, to say
nothing of good gold pieces. You must be joking to
talk like this of hanging us; have we stolen anything
from you?”</p>

<p>When the King heard him speak so boldly, he did not
know what to think, and he felt half inclined to let them
and their sister go without putting them to death; but his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">(173)</span>
chief adviser, who was an arrant flatterer, dissuaded him
from this, telling him that if he did not revenge the insult
that had been put upon him, all the world would make
fun of him, and look upon him as nothing better than a
miserable little King worth a few coppers a day. The
King thereupon swore that he would never forgive them,
and ordered them to be brought to trial at once. This
did not take long; the judges had only to look at the
real Rosette’s portrait and then at the Princess who had
arrived, and without hesitation, they ordered the prisoners’
heads to be cut off as a punishment for having lied to the
King, since they had promised him a beautiful Princess,
and had only given him an ugly peasant girl. They
repaired with great ceremony to the prison to read this
sentence to them; but the prisoners declared that they
had not lied, that their sister was a Princess, and more
beautiful than the day; that there must be something
under this which they did not understand, and they asked
for a respite of seven days, as before that time had expired
their innocence might have been established.
The King of the Peacocks, who had worked himself up
to a high pitch of anger, could with great difficulty be
induced to accord them this grace, but at last he consented.</p>

<p>While these things were going on at the Court, we must
say something about poor Rosette. Both she and Fretillon
were very much astonished, when daylight came, to find
themselves in the middle of the sea, without a boat, and
far from all help. She began to cry, and cried so piteously,
that even the fishes had compassion on her: she did not
know what to do, nor what would become of her. “There
is no doubt,” she said, “that the King of the Peacocks
ordered me to be thrown into the sea, having repented his
promise of marrying me, and to get rid of me quietly he
has had me drowned. What a strange man!” she continued,
“for I should have loved him so much! We should have
been so happy together,” and with that she burst out crying
afresh, for she could not help still loving him. She remained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">(174)</span>
floating about on the sea for two days, wet to the skin,
and almost dead with cold; she was so benumbed by
it, that if it had not been for little Fretillon, who lay
beside her and kept a little warmth in her, she could
not have survived. She was famished with hunger, and
seeing the oysters in their shells, she took as many of
these as she wanted and ate them; Fretillon did the
same, to keep himself alive, although he did not like
such food. Rosette became still more alarmed when
the night set in. “Fretillon,” she said, “keep on barking,
to frighten away the soles, for fear they should eat us.”
So Fretillon barked all night, and when the morning
came, the Princess was floating near the shore. Close to
the sea at this spot, there lived a good old man; he
was poor, and did not care for the things of the world,
and no one ever visited him in his little hut. He was
very much surprised when he heard Fretillon barking,
for no dogs ever came in that direction; he thought
some travellers must have lost their way, and went out
with the kind intention of putting them on the right
road again. All at once he caught sight of the Princess
and Fretillon floating on the sea, and the Princess,
seeing him, stretched out her arms to him, crying out,
“Good man, save me, or I shall perish; I have been in
the water like this for two days.” When he heard her
speak so sorrowfully, he had great pity on her, and went
back into his hut to fetch a long hook; he waded into
the water up to his neck, and once or twice narrowly
escaped drowning. At last, however, he succeeded in
dragging the bed on to the shore. Rosette and Fretillon
were overjoyed to find themselves again on dry ground;
and were full of gratitude to the kind old man. Rosette
wrapped herself in her coverlet, and walked bare-footed
into the hut, where the old man lit a little fire of dry
straw, and took one of his dead wife’s best dresses out
of a trunk, with some stockings and shoes, and gave
them to the Princess. Dressed in her peasant’s attire,
she looked as beautiful as the day, and Fretillon capered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">(175)</span>
round her and made her laugh. The old man guessed
that Rosette was some great lady, for her bed was embroidered
with gold and silver, and her mattress was
of satin. He begged her to tell him her story, promising
not to repeat what she told him if she so wished.
So she related to him all that had befallen her, crying
bitterly the while, for she still thought that it was
the King of the Peacocks who had ordered her to be
drowned.</p>

<p>“What shall we do, my daughter?” said the old man.
“You are a Princess and accustomed to the best of everything,
and I have but poor fare to offer, black bread and
radishes; but if you will let me, I will go and tell the King
of the Peacocks that you are here; if he had once seen you,
he would assuredly marry you.” “Alas! he is a wicked
man,” said Rosette; “he would only put me to death; but
if you can lend me a little basket, I will tie it round Fretillon’s
neck, and he will have very bad luck, if he does not manage
to bring back some food.”</p>

<p>The old man gave her a basket, which she fastened to
Fretillon’s neck, and then said, “Go to the best kitchen in
the town, and bring me back what you find in the saucepan.”
Fretillon ran off to the town, and as there was no better
kitchen than that of the King, he went in, uncovered the
saucepan, and cleverly carried off all that was in it; then
he returned to the hut. Rosette said to him, “Go back
and take whatever you can find of the best in the larder.”
Fretillon went back to the King’s larder, and took white
bread, wine, and all sorts of fruits and sweetmeats; he was
so laden that he could only just manage to carry the things
home.</p>

<p>When the King of the Peacocks’ dinner hour arrived,
there was nothing for him either in the saucepan or in the
larder; his attendants looked askance at one another, and
the King was in a terrible rage. “It seems, then, that I
am to have no dinner; but see that the spit is put before
the fire, and let me have some good roast meat this evening.”
The evening came, and the Princess said to Fretillon, “Go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">(176)</span>
to the best kitchen in the town and bring me a joint of
good roast meat.” Fretillon obeyed, and knowing no better
kitchen than that of the King, he went softly in, while the
cooks’ backs were turned, took the meat, which was of the
best kind, from the spit, and carried it back in his basket
to the Princess. She sent him back without delay to the
larder, and he carried off all the preserves and sweetmeats
that had been prepared for the King.</p>

<p>The King, having had no dinner, was very hungry, and
ordered supper to be served early, but no supper was
forthcoming; enraged beyond words, he was forced to go
supperless to bed.</p>

<p>The same thing happened the following day, both as to
dinner and supper; so that the King, for three days, was
without meat or drink, for every time he sat down to table,
it was found that the meal that had been prepared had been
stolen. His chief adviser, fearing for the life of the King,
hid himself in the corner of the kitchen to watch; he kept
his eyes on the saucepan, that was boiling over the fire, and
what was his surprise to see enter a little green dog, with
one ear, that uncovered the pot, and put the meat in its
basket. He followed it to see where it would go; he saw
it leave the town, and still following, came to the old man’s
hut. Then he went and told the King that it was to a poor
peasant’s home that the food was carried morning and evening.
The <span id="cor176">King</span> was greatly astonished, and ordered more
inquiries to be made. His chief adviser, anxious for favour,
decided to go himself, taking with him a body of archers.
They found the old man and Rosette at dinner, eating the
meat that had been stolen from the King’s kitchen, and they
seized them, and bound them with cords, taking Fretillon
prisoner at the same time.</p>

<p>They brought word to the King that the delinquents
had been captured, and he replied, “To-morrow, the last
day of reprieve for my two insolent prisoners will expire;
they and these thieves shall die together.” He then went
into his court of justice. The old man threw himself on
his knees before him, and begged to be allowed to tell him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">(177)</span>
everything. As he was speaking, the King looked towards
the beautiful Princess, and his heart was touched when he
saw her crying. When, therefore, the old man said that
she was the Princess Rosette who had been thrown into
the water, in spite of the weak condition he was in from
having starved for so long, he gave three bounds of joy,
ran and embraced her, and untied her cords, declaring the
while that he loved her with all his heart.</p>

<p>They at once went to find the Princes, who thought
they were going to be put to death, and came forward in
great dejection and hanging their heads; the nurse and
her daughter were brought in at the same time. The
brothers and sister recognised one another, as soon as
they were brought face to face, and Rosette threw herself
on her brothers’ necks. The nurse and her daughter,
and the boatman, begged on their knees for mercy, and the
universal rejoicing and their own joy were so great, that
the King and the Princess pardoned them, and gave the
good old man a handsome reward, and from that time he
continued to live in the palace.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp10" id="image177">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/image177.png"><img class="w100" src="images/image177_small.png" alt="" title="Fretillon"></a>
</figure>

<p>Finally, the King of the Peacocks did all in his power to
atone for his conduct to the King and his brother, expressing
the deepest regret at having treated them so badly. The
nurse restored to Rosette all her beautiful clothes and
the bushel of golden crowns, and the
wedding festivities lasted a fortnight.
Everyone was happy down to Fretillon,
who ate nothing but partridge wings
for the rest of his life.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“Now,” said King Oberon, when the
French Fay had finished, “let us hear
of the doings in another part of the
world.”</p>

<p>Then up sprang a Norwegian Dwarf—a
funny little fellow with a red pointed cap on his head—and
exclaimed, “I can tell you of the doings of one
of those naughty rascals who get a bad name with mankind,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">(178)</span>
of how he had a terrible fight with a big white bear
and of how he was at length driven away.”</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">One Christmas Day, the King of Norway sat in the
great hall of his palace, holding a feast. “Here’s a health,”
said he, “to our brother the King of Denmark! What
present shall we send our royal brother, as a pledge of our
good-will, this Christmas-time?” “Send him, please your
majesty,” said the Norseman Gunter, who was the king’s
chief huntsman, “one of our fine white bears, that his
liegemen may show their little ones what sort of kittens we
play with.” “Well said, Gunter!” cried the king; “but
how shall we find a bear that will travel so long a journey
willingly, and will know how to behave himself to our
worthy brother when he reaches him?” “Please your
majesty,” said Gunter, “I have a glorious fellow, as white
as snow, that I caught when he was a cub; he will follow
me wherever I go, play with my children, stand on his
hind legs, and behave himself as well as any gentleman
ought to do. He is at your service, and I will myself take
him wherever you choose.”</p>

<p>So the king was well pleased, and ordered Gunter to
set off at once with master Bruin: “Start with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">(180)</span>
morning’s dawn,” said he, “and make the best of your
way.”</p>

<p>The Norseman went home to his house in the forest;
and early next morning he waked master Bruin, put the
king’s collar round his neck, and away they went over
rocks and valleys, lakes and seas, the nearest road to the
court of the King of Denmark. When they arrived there,
the king was away on a journey, and Gunter and his fellow-traveller
set out to follow. It was bright weather, the sun
shone, and the birds sang, as they journeyed merrily on,
day after day, over hill and over dale, till they came within
a day’s journey of where the king was.</p>

<p>All that afternoon they travelled through a gloomy, dark
forest; but towards evening the wind began to whistle
through the trees, and the clouds began to gather and
threaten a stormy night. The road, too, was very rough,
and it was not easy to tell which was most tired, Bruin or
his master. What made the matter worse was, that they
had found no inn that day by the roadside, and their
provisions had fallen short, so that they had no very
pleasant prospect before them for the night. “A pretty
affair this!” said Gunter, “I am likely to be charmingly
off here in the woods, with an empty stomach, a damp
bed, and a bear for my bedfellow.”</p>

<p>While the Norseman was turning this over in his mind,
the wind blew harder and harder, and the clouds grew
darker and darker: the bear shook his ears, and his master
looked at his wits’ end, when to his great joy a woodman
came whistling along out of the woods, by the side of his
horse dragging a load of faggots. As soon as he came up,
Gunter stopped him, and begged hard for a night’s lodging
for himself and his countryman.</p>

<p>The woodman seemed hearty and good-natured enough,
and was quite ready to find shelter for the huntsman; but
as to the bear, he had never seen such a beast before in
his life, and would have nothing to do with him on any
terms. The huntsman begged hard for his friend, and
told how he was bringing him as a present to the King of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">(181)</span>
Denmark; and how he was the most good-natured, best-behaved
animal in the world, though he must allow that
he was by no means one of the handsomest.</p>

<p>The woodman, however, was not to be moved. His
wife, he was sure, would not like such a guest, and who
could say what he might take it into his head to do?
Besides, he should lose his dog and his cat, his ducks and
his geese; for they would all run away for fright, whether
the bear was disposed to be friends with them or not.</p>

<p>“Good-night, master huntsman!” said he; “if you and
old shaggy-back there cannot part, I am afraid you must
e’en stay where you are, though you will have a sad night
of it, no doubt.” Then he cracked his whip, whistled up
his horse, and set off once more on his way homewards.</p>

<div class="chapter fullpage">

  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/image182.png"><img class="fullpage" src="images/image182_small.png" alt="" title="He lets them loose"></a>
</figure>
</div>

<p>The huntsman grumbled, and Bruin grunted, as they
followed slowly after; when to their great joy they saw
the woodman, before he had gone many yards, pull up
his horse once more and turn round. “Stay, stay!” said
he; “I think I can tell you of a plan better than sleeping
in a ditch. I know where you may find shelter, if you will
run the risk of a little trouble from an unlucky imp, that
has taken up its abode in my old house down the hill
yonder. You must know, friend, that till last winter I lived
in yon snug little house that you will see at the foot of the
hill if you come this way. Everything went smoothly on with
us till one unlucky night, when the storm blew as it seems
likely to do to-night, some spiteful guest took it into his
head to pay us a visit; and there have ever since been
such noises, clattering, and scampering up stairs and down,
from midnight till the cock crows in the morning, that at
last we were fairly driven out of house and home. What
he is like no one knows; for we never saw him or anything
belonging to him, except a little crooked high-heeled
shoe, that he left one night in the pantry. But
though we have not seen him, we know he has a hand
or a paw as heavy as lead; for when it pleases him to
lay it upon any one, down he goes as if the blacksmith’s
hammer had hit him. There is no end of his monkey<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">(182)</span>
tricks. If the linen is hung
out to dry, he cuts the line.
If he wants a cup of ale, he
leaves the tap running. If
the fowls are shut up, he lets
them loose. He puts the pig
into the garden, rides
upon the cows, and
turns the horses into
the hay-yard; and
several times he nearly
burnt the house down,
by leaving a candle
alight among
the faggots.
And then he is
sometimes so nimble
and active, that when
he is once in motion,
nothing stands still
around him. Dishes
and plates—pots and
pans—dance about,
clattering, making
the most horrible
music, and breaking
each other to pieces:
and sometimes, when the
whim takes him, the chairs
and tables seem as if they
were alive, and dancing a
hornpipe, or playing battledore
and shuttlecock together.
Even the stones and beams of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">(183)</span>
house seem rattling against one another; and it is of
no use putting things in order, for the first freak the imp
took would turn everything upside down again.</p>

<p>“My wife and I bore such a lodger as long as we
could, but at length we were fairly beaten; and as he
seemed to have taken up his abode in the house, we
thought it best to give up to him what he wanted: and
the little rascal knew what we were about when we were
moving, and seemed afraid we should not go soon enough.
So he helped us off: for on the morning we were to start,
as we were going to put our goods upon the waggon,
there it stood before the door ready loaded: and when
we started we heard a loud laugh; and a little sharp
voice cried out of the window, ‘Good-bye, neighbours!’
So now he has our old house all to himself to play his
gambols in, whenever he likes to sleep within doors; and
we have built ourselves a snug cottage on the other side
of the hill, where we live as well as we can, though we
have no great room to make merry in. Now if you, and
your ugly friend there, like to run the hazard of taking
up your quarters in the elf’s house, pray do! Yonder is
the road. He may not be at home to-night.”</p>

<p>“We will try our luck,” said Gunter: “anything is
better to my mind than sleeping out of doors such a night
as this. Your troublesome neighbour will perhaps think
so too, and we may have to fight for our lodging: but
never mind, Bruin is rather an awkward hand to quarrel
with; and the goblin may perhaps find a worse welcome
from him than your house-dog could give him. He will
at any rate let him know what a bear’s hug is; for I dare
say he has not been far enough north to know much
about it yet.”</p>

<p>Then the woodman gave Gunter a faggot to make his
fire with, and wished him a good-night. He and the bear
soon found their way to the deserted house; and no one
being at home they walked into the kitchen and made a
capital fire.</p>

<p>“Lack-a-day!” said the Norseman; “I forgot one thing—I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">(184)</span>
ought to have asked that good man for some supper;
I have nothing left but some dry bread. However, this is
better than sleeping in the woods: we must make the
most of what we have, keep ourselves warm, and get to
bed as soon as we can.” So after eating up all their
crusts, and drinking some water from the well close by,
the huntsman wrapt himself up close in his cloak, and lay
down in the snuggest corner he could find. Bruin rolled
himself up in the corner of the wide fire-place; and both
were fast asleep, the fire out, and everything quiet within
doors, long before midnight.</p>

<p>Just as the clock struck twelve the storm began to get
louder—the wind blew—a slight noise within the room
wakened the huntsman, and all on a sudden in popped
a little ugly skrattel, scarce three spans high; with a
hump on his back, a face like a dried pippin, a nose like
a ripe mulberry, and an eye that had lost its neighbour.
He had high-heeled shoes, and a pointed
red cap; and came dragging after him a nice fat kid,
ready skinned, and fit for roasting. “A rough night
this,” grumbled the goblin to himself; “but, thanks to
that booby woodman, I’ve a house to myself: and now
for a hot supper and a glass of good ale till the cock
crows.”</p>

<p>No sooner said than done: the skrattel busied himself
about, here and there; presently the fire blazed up, the
kid was put on the spit and turned merrily round. A keg
of ale made its appearance from a closet: the cloth was
laid, and the kid was soon dished up for eating. Then
the little imp, in the joy of his heart, rubbed his hands,
tossed up his red cap, danced before the hearth, and sang
his song—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Oh! ’tis weary enough abroad to bide,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In the shivery midnight blast;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And ’tis dreary enough alone to ride,</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">Hungry and cold,</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">On the wintry wold,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Where the drifting snow falls fast.</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">(185)</span>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“But ’tis cheery enough to revel by night,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In the crackling faggot’s light:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Tis merry enough to have and to hold</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">The savoury roast,</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">And the nut-brown toast,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With jolly good ale and old.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The huntsman lay snug all this time; sometimes quaking,
in dread of getting into trouble, and sometimes licking his
lips at the savoury supper before him, and half in the
mind to fight for it with the imp. However, he kept
himself quiet in his corner; till all of a sudden the little
man’s eye wandered from his cheering ale-cup to Bruin’s
carcase, as he lay rolled up like a ball, fast asleep in the
chimney-corner.</p>

<p>The imp turned round sharp in an instant, and crept
softly nearer and nearer to where Bruin lay, looking at
him very closely, and not able to make out what in the
world he was. “One of the family, I suppose!” said he
to himself. But just then Bruin gave his ears a shake,
and showed a little of his shaggy muzzle. “Oh ho!”
said the imp, “that’s all, is it? But what a large one!
Where could he come from? and how came he here?
What shall I do? Shall I let him alone or drive him
out? Perhaps he may do me some mischief, and I am not
afraid of mice or rats. So here goes! I have driven all
the rest of the live stock out of the house, and why should
I be afraid of sending this brute after them?”</p>

<p>With that the elf walked softly to the corner of the
room, and taking up the spit, stole back on tip-toe till he
got quite close to the bear; then raising up his weapon,
down came a rattling thump across Bruin’s mazard, that
sounded as hollow as a drum. The bear raised himself
slowly up, snorted, shook his head, then scratched it,—opened
first one eye, then the other, took a turn across the
room, and grinned at his enemy; who, somewhat alarmed,
ran back a few paces, and stood with the spit in his hand,
foreseeing a rough attack. And it soon came; for the
bear, rearing himself up, walked leisurely forward, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">(186)</span>
putting out one of his paws caught hold of the spit, jerked
it out of the goblin’s hand, and sent it spinning to the
other end of the kitchen.</p>

<p>And now began a fierce battle. This way and that way
flew tables and chairs, pots and pans. The elf was one
moment on the bear’s back, lugging his ears and pommelling
him with blows that might have felled an ox. In the next,
the bear would throw him up in the air, and treat him as
he came down with a hug that would make the little imp
squall. Then up he would jump upon one of the beams
out of Bruin’s reach; and soon, watching his chance, would
be down astride upon his back.</p>

<p>Meantime Gunter had become sadly frightened, and
seeing the oven door open, crept in for shelter from the
fray, and lay there quaking for fear. The struggle went on
thus a long time, without its seeming at all clear who would
get the better—biting, scratching, hugging, clawing, roaring,
and growling, till the whole house rang. The elf, however,
seemed to grow weaker and weaker: the rivals stood for a
moment as if to get breath, and the bear was getting ready
for a fierce attack, when, all in a moment, the skrattel
dashed his red cap right in his eye, and while Bruin was
smarting with the blow and trying to recover his sight,
darted to the door, and was out of sight in a moment,
though the wind blew, the rain pattered, and the storm
raged, in a merciless manner.</p>

<p>“Well done! Bravo, Bruin!” cried the huntsman, as
he crawled out of the oven, and ran and bolted the door:
“thou hast combed his locks rarely; and as for thine own
ears, they are rather the worse for pulling. But come, let
us make the best of the good cheer our friend has left us!”
So saying, they fell to and ate a hearty supper. The huntsman,
wishing the skrattel a good night and pleasant dreams
in a cup of his sparkling ale, laid himself down and slept
till morning; and Bruin tried to do the same, as well as
his aching bones would let him.</p>

<p>In the morning the huntsman made ready to set out on
his way: and had not got far from the door before he met<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">(189)</span>
the woodman, who was eager to hear how he had passed
the night. Then Gunter told him how he had been
awakened, what sort of creature the elf was, and how he
and Bruin had fought it out. “Let us hope,” said he,
“you will now be well rid of the gentleman: I suspect he
will not come where he is likely to get any more of Bruin’s
hugs; and thus you will be well paid for your entertainment
of us, which, to tell the truth, was none of the best:
for if your ugly little tenant had not brought his supper
with him, we should have had but empty stomachs this
morning.”</p>

</figure>
</div>

<p>The huntsman and his fellow-traveller journeyed on:
and let us hope they reached the King of Denmark safe
and sound: but, to tell the truth, I know nothing more of
that part of the story.</p>

<p>The woodman, meantime, went to his work; and did
not fail to watch at night to see whether the skrattel came,
or whether he was thoroughly frightened out of his old
haunt by the bear, or whatever he might take the beast to
be that had handled him as he never was handled before.
But three nights passed over, and no traces being seen or
heard of him, the woodman began to think of moving back
to his old house.</p>

<p>On the fourth day he was out at his work in the forest;
and as he was taking shelter under a tree from a cold
storm of sleet and rain that passed over, he heard a little
cracked voice singing, or rather croaking in a mournful tone.
So he crept along quietly, and peeped over some bushes,
and there sat the very same figure that the huntsman had
described to him. The goblin was sitting without any hat
or cap on his head, with a woe-begone face, and with his
jacket torn into shreds, and his leg scratched and smeared
with blood, as if he had been creeping through a bramble-bush.
The woodman listened quietly to his song, and it
ran as before—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Oh! ’tis weary enough abroad to bide,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In the shivery midnight blast;</div>

    <div class="verse indent6">Hungry and cold,</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">On the wintry wold,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where the drifting snow falls fast.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Sing us the other verse, man!” cried the woodman;
for he could not help cracking a joke on his old enemy,
who he saw was sadly in the dumps at the loss of his good
cheer and the shelter against the bad weather. But the
instant his voice was heard the little imp jumped up,
stamped with rage, and was out of sight in the twinkling of
an eye.</p>

<p>The woodman finished his work and was going home in
the evening, whistling by his horse’s side, when, all of a
sudden, he saw, standing on a high bank by the wayside,
the very same little imp, looking as grim and sulky as
before. “Hark ye, bumpkin?” cried the skrattel; “canst
thou hear, fellow? Is thy great cat alive, and at home
still?” “My cat?” said the woodman. “Thy great white
cat, man!” thundered out the little imp. “Oh, my cat!”
said the woodman, at last recollecting himself. “Oh, yes
to be sure! alive and well, I thank you: very happy, I’m
sure, to see you and all friends, whenever you will do us
the favour to call. And hark ye, friend! as you seem to be
so fond of my great cat, you may like to know that she had
five kittens last night.” “Five kittens?” muttered the elf.
“Yes,” replied the woodman, “five of the most beautiful
white kits you ever saw,—so like the old cat, it would do
your heart good to see the whole family—such soft, gentle
paws—such delicate whiskers—such pretty little mouths!”
“Five kittens?” muttered or rather shrieked out the imp
again. “Yes, to be sure!” said the woodman; “five
kittens! Do look in to-night, about twelve o’clock—the
time, you know, that you used to come and see us. The
old cat will be so glad to show them to you, and we shall be
so happy to see you once more. But where can you have
been all this time?”</p>

<p>“I come? not I, indeed!” shrieked the skrattel.
“What do I want with the little wretches? Did not I see
the mother once? Keep your kittens to yourself: I must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">(191)</span>
be off,—this is no place for me. Five kittens! So there
are six of them now! Good-bye to you, you’ll see me no
more; so bad luck to your ugly cat and your beggarly
house!” “And bad luck to you, Mr Crookback!” cried
the woodman, as he threw him the red cap he had left
behind in his battle with Bruin. “Keep clear of my cat,
and let us hear no more of your pranks, and be hanged to
you!”</p>

  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/image191.png"><img class="w100" src="images/image191_small.png" alt="" title="The elf was one moment on the bear’s back"></a>
</figure>

<p>So, now that he knew his troublesome guest had taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">(192)</span>
his leave, the woodman soon moved back all his goods, and
his wife and children into their snug old house. And there
they lived happily, for the elf never came to see them any
more; and the woodman every day after dinner drank,
“Long life to the King of Norway,” for sending the cat that
cleared his house of vermin.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>When the Norwegian Red-cap had finished his story
Titania thought it time that someone should tell another
love tale, and a second German Fairy came forward and
said,</p>

<p>“Would your majesty like to hear again the story of the
goose-girl princess and the horse Falada?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” answered the Queen, who if she really liked a
story was always glad to hear it told to her several times,
“Oh, yes, the pretty story of the goose-girl is one of my
favourites.”</p>

<p>The second German Fairy then stepped on to the stool
and quietly began to recount the sad experiences of the
princess who became</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="the_goose_girl">The Goose Girl</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The king of a great land died, and
left his queen to take care of their
only child. This child was a
daughter, who was very beautiful;
and her mother loved her dearly,
and was very kind to her. And
there was a good fairy too, who was fond of the princess,
and helped her mother to watch over her. When she
grew up, she was betrothed to a prince who lived a great
way off; and as the time drew near for her to be married,
she got ready to set off on her journey to his country.
Then the queen, her mother, packed up a great many
costly things; jewels, and gold, and silver; trinkets, fine
dresses, and in short everything that became a royal bride.
And she gave her a waiting-maid to ride with her, and
give her into the bridegroom’s hands; and each had a
horse for the journey. Now the princess’s horse was the
fairy’s gift, and it was called Falada, and could speak.</p>

<p>When the time came for them to set out, the fairy went
into her bed-chamber, and took a little knife, and cut off
a lock of her hair, and gave it to the princess, and said,
“Take care of it, dear child; for it is a charm that may
be of use to you on the road.” Then they all took a
sorrowful leave of the princess; and she put the lock of
hair into her bosom, got upon her horse, and set off on
her journey to her bridegroom’s kingdom.</p>

<p>One day, as they were riding along by a brook, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">(194)</span>
princess began to feel very thirsty; and she said to her
maid, “Pray get down, and fetch me some water in my
golden cup out of yonder brook, for I want to drink.”
“Nay,” said the maid, “if you are thirsty, get off yourself,
and stoop down by the water and drink; I shall not
be your waiting-maid any longer.” Then she was so thirsty
that she got down, and knelt over the little brook, and
drank; for she was frightened, and dared not bring out
her golden cup; and she wept and said, “Alas! what
will become of me?” And the lock answered her, and
said—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But the princess was very gentle and meek, so she said
nothing to her maid’s ill behaviour, but got upon her
horse again.</p>

<p>Then all rode further on their journey, till the day grew
so warm, and the sun so scorching, that the bride began
to feel very thirsty again; and at last, when they came to
a river, she forgot her maid’s rude speech, and said, “Pray
get down, and fetch me some water to drink in my golden
cup.” But the maid answered her, and even spoke more
haughtily than before: “Drink if you will, but I shall not
be your waiting-maid.” Then the princess was so thirsty
that she got off her horse, and lay down, and held her
head over the running stream, and cried and said, “What
will become of me?” And the lock of hair answered her
again—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And as she leaned down to drink the lock of hair fell
from her bosom, and floated away with the water. Now
she was so frightened that she did not see it; but her
maid saw it, and was very glad, for she knew the charm;
and she saw that the poor bride would be in her power,
now that she had lost the hair. So when the bride had
done drinking, and would have got upon Falada again, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">(195)</span>
maid said, “I shall ride upon Falada, and you may have
my horse instead”: so she was forced to give up her horse,
and soon afterwards to take off her royal clothes and put
on her maid’s shabby ones.</p>

<p>At last, as they drew near the end of their journey, this
treacherous servant threatened to kill her mistress if she
ever told any one what had happened. But Falada saw it
all, and marked it well.</p>

<p>Then the waiting-maid got upon Falada, and the real
bride rode upon the other horse, and they went on in this
way till at last they came to the royal court. There was
great joy at their coming, and the prince flew to meet them,
and lifted the maid from her horse, thinking she was the
one who was to be his wife; and she was led upstairs to
the royal chamber; but the true princess was told to stay
in the court below.</p>

<p>Now the old king happened just then to have nothing
else to do; so he amused himself by sitting at his kitchen-window,
looking at what was going on; and he saw her in
the courtyard. As she looked very pretty, and too delicate
for a waiting-maid, he went up into the royal chamber to
ask the bride who it was she had brought with her, that
was thus left standing in the court below. “I brought her
with me for the sake of her company on the road,” said
she; “pray give the girl some work to do, that she may
not be idle.” The old king could not for some time think
of any work for her to do; but at last he said, “I have a
lad who takes care of my geese; she may go and help
him.” Now the name of this lad, that the real bride was
to help in watching the king’s geese, was Curdken.</p>

<p>But the false bride said to the prince, “Dear husband,
pray do me one piece of kindness.” “That I will,” said
the prince. “Then tell one of your slaughterers to cut
off the head of the horse I rode upon, for it was very unruly,
and plagued me sadly on the road”; but the truth
was, she was very much afraid lest Falada should some day
or other speak, and tell all she had done to the princess.
She carried her point, and the faithful Falada was killed;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">(196)</span>
but when the true princess heard of it, she wept, and
begged the man to nail up Falada’s head against a large
dark gate of the city, through which she had to pass every
morning and evening, that there she might still see him
sometimes. Then the slaughterer said he would do as she
wished; and cut off the head, and nailed it up under the
dark gate.</p>

<p>Early the next morning, as she and Curdken went out
through the gate, she said sorrowfully—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and the head answered—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Bride, bride, there thou gangest!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then they went out of the city, and drove the geese
on. And when she came to the meadow, she sat down
upon a bank there, and let down her waving locks of
hair, which were all of pure silver; and when Curdken
saw it glitter in the sun, he ran up, and would have pulled
some of the locks out, but she cried—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Blow, breezes, blow!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let Curdken’s hat go!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Blow, breezes, blow!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let him after it go!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O’er hills, dales, and rocks,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Away be it whirl’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till the silvery locks</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Are all comb’d and curl’d!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Then there came a wind, so strong that it blew off
Curdken’s hat; and away it flew over the hills: and he
was forced to turn and run after it; till, by the time he
came back, she had done combing and curling her hair,
and had put it up again safe. Then he was very angry
and sulky, and would not speak to her at all; but they
watched the geese until it grew dark in the evening, and
then drove them homewards.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">(199)</span></p>

<p>The next morning, as they were going through the dark
gate, the poor girl looked up at Falada’s head, and cried—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and it answered—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Bride, bride, there thou gangest!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Then she drove on the geese, and sat down again in the
meadow, and began to comb out her hair as before; and
Curdken ran up to her, and wanted to take hold of it; but
she cried out quickly—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Blow, breezes, blow!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let Curdken’s hat go!</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Let him after it go!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O’er hills, dales, and rocks,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Away be it whirl’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till the silvery locks</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Are all comb’d and curl’d!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Then a wind came and blew away his hat; and off it flew
a great way, over the hills and far away, so that he had to
run after it; and when he came back she had bound up
her hair again, and all was safe. So they watched the
geese till it grew dark.</p>

<p>In the evening, after they came home, Curdken went
to the old king, and said, “I cannot have that strange girl
to help me to keep the geese any longer.” “Why?” said
the king. “Because, instead of doing any good, she does
nothing but tease me all day long.” Then the king made
him tell him what had happened. And Curdken said,
“When we go in the morning through the dark gate with our
flock of geese, she cries and talks with the head of a horse
that hangs upon the wall, and says—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and the head answers,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">(200)</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Bride, bride, there thou gangest!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And Curdken went on telling the king what had happened
upon the meadow where the geese fed; how his hat was
blown away; and how he was forced to run after it, and
to leave his flock of geese to themselves. But the old
king told the boy to go out again the next day: and when
morning came, he placed himself behind the dark gate, and
heard how she spoke to Falada, and how Falada answered.
Then he went into the field, and hid himself in a bush by
the meadow’s side; and he soon saw with his own eyes
how they drove the flock of geese; and how after a little
time, she let down her hair that glittered in the sun. And
then he heard her say—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Blow, breezes, blow!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let Curdken’s hat go!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Blow, breezes, blow!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let him after it go!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O’er hills, dales, and rocks,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Away be it whirl’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till the silvery locks</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Are all comb’d and curl’d!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And soon came a gale of wind, and carried away
Curdken’s hat, and away went Curdken after it, while the
girl went on combing and curling her hair. All this the
old king saw: so he went home without being seen; and
when the little goose-girl came back in the evening he
called her aside, and asked her why she did so: but she
burst into tears, and said, “That I must not tell you or
any man, or I shall lose my life.”</p>

<p>But the old king begged so hard, that she had no peace
till she had told him all the tale, from beginning to end,
word for word. And it was very lucky for her that she
did so, for when she had done the king ordered royal
clothes to be put upon her, and gazed on her with wonder,
she was so beautiful. Then he called his son, and told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">(201)</span>
him that he had only the false bride; for that she was
merely a waiting-maid, while the true bride stood by.
And the young king rejoiced when he saw her beauty,
and heard how meek and patient she had
been; and without saying anything to the
false bride, the king ordered a great feast to be
got ready for all his court. The bridegroom sat
at the top, with the false princess on one
side, and the true one on the
other; but nobody knew
her again, for her beauty
was quite dazzling to their
eyes; and she did not seem
at all like the little goose-girl,
now that she had her
brilliant dress on.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp20" id="image201">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/image201.png"><img class="w100" src="images/image201_small.png" alt="" title="Tailpiece"></a>
</figure>

<p>When they had eaten and
drank, and were very merry,
the old king said he would
tell them a tale. So he
began, and told all the story of the princess, as if
it was one that he had once heard; and he asked
the true waiting-maid what she thought ought to be done
to any one who would behave thus. “Nothing better,”
said this false bride, “than that she should be thrown
into a cask stuck round with sharp nails, and that two
white horses should be put to it, and should drag it from
street to street till she was dead.” “Thou art she!” said
the old king; “and as thou hast judged thyself, so shall it
be done to thee.” And the young king was then married
to his true wife, and they reigned over the kingdom in
peace and happiness all their lives; and the good fairy came
to see them, and restored the faithful Falada to life again.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Having finished her tale, the second German Fairy was
rising to return to her place in the circle, when King
Oberon, who saw how pleased the Queen was made her yet
better pleased by saying,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">(202)</span></p>

<p>“Perhaps we can have another story from the same

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Queen Titania, and the Fairy sat
down again, and without any false modesty began the
tale of</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="the_water_of_life">The Water of Life</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Long before you or I were born, there reigned, in a
country a great way off, a king who had three sons. This
king once fell very ill,—so ill that nobody thought he could
live. His sons were very much grieved at their father’s
sickness; and as they were walking together very mournfully
in the garden of the palace, a little old man met them
and asked what was the matter. They told him that their
father was very ill, and that they were afraid nothing could
save him. “I know what would,” said the little old man;
“it is the Water of Life. If he could have a draught of it
he would be well again; but it is very hard to get.”
Then the eldest son said, “I will soon find it”: and he
went to the sick king, and begged that he might go in
search of the Water of Life, as it was the only thing that
could save him. “No,” said the king, “I had rather die
than place you in such great danger as you must meet with
in your journey.” But he begged so hard that the king let
him go; and the prince thought to himself, “if I bring
my father this water, he will make me sole heir to his
kingdom.”</p>

<p>Then he set out: and when he had gone on his way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">(204)</span>
some time he came to a deep valley, overhung with rocks
and woods; and as he looked around, he saw standing
above him on one of the rocks a little ugly dwarf, with a
sugarloaf cap and a scarlet cloak; and the dwarf called to
him and said, “Prince, whither so fast?” “What is that
to thee, you ugly imp?” said the prince haughtily, and
rode on.</p>

<p>But the dwarf was enraged at his behaviour, and laid a
fairy spell of ill-luck upon him; so that as he rode on the
mountain pass became narrower and narrower, and at last
the way was so straightened that he could not go a step
forward: and when he thought to have turned his horse
round and go back the way he came, he heard a loud
laugh ringing round him, and found that the path was
closed behind him, so that he was shut in all round. He
next tried to get off his horse and make his way on foot,
but again the laugh rang in his ears, and he found himself
unable to move a step, and thus he was forced to abide
<span id="cor204">spellbound</span>.</p>

<p>Meantime the old king was lingering on in daily hope of
his son’s return, till at last the second son said, “Father, I
will go in search of the Water of Life.” For he thought
to himself, “My brother is surely dead, and the kingdom
will fall to me if I find the water.” The king was at first
very unwilling to let him go, but at last yielded to his wish.
So he set out and followed the same road which his
brother had done, and met with the same little elf, who
stopped him at the same spot in the mountains, saying, as
before, “Prince, prince, whither so fast?” “Mind your
own affairs, busy-body!” said the prince, scornfully, and
rode on.</p>

<p>But the dwarf put the same spell upon him as he had
put on his elder brother; and he, too, was at last obliged
to take up his abode in the heart of the mountains. Thus
it is with proud, silly people, who think themselves above
every one else, and are too proud to ask or take advice.</p>

<p>When the second prince had thus been gone a long
time, the youngest son said he would go and search for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">(205)</span>
the Water of Life, and trusted he should soon be able to
make his father well again. So he set out, and the dwarf
met him too at the same spot in the valley, among the
mountains, and said, “Prince, whither so fast?” And the
prince said, “I am going in search of the Water of Life;
because my father is ill, and like to die: can you help
me? Pray be kind, and aid me if you can!” “Do you
know where it is to be found?” asked the dwarf. “No,”
said the prince, “I do not. Pray tell me if you know.”
“Then as you have spoken to me kindly, and are wise
enough to seek for advice, I will tell you how and where to
go. The water you seek springs from a well in an
enchanted castle; and, that you may be able to reach it in
safety, I will give you an iron wand and two little loaves
of bread; strike the iron door of the castle three times
with the wand, and it will open: two hungry lions will be
lying down inside gaping for their prey, but if you throw
them the bread they will let you pass; then hasten on to
the well, and take some of the Water of Life before the
clock strikes twelve; for if you tarry longer the door will
shut upon you for ever.”</p>

<p>Then the prince thanked his little friend with the scarlet
cloak for his friendly aid; and took the wand and the
bread, and went travelling on and on, over sea and over
land, till he came to his journey’s end, and found everything
to be as the dwarf had told him. The door flew
open at the third stroke of the wand, and when the lions
were quieted he went on through the castle and came at
length to a beautiful hall. Around it he saw several
knights sitting in a trance; then he pulled off their rings
and put them on his own fingers. In another room he
saw on a table a sword and a loaf of bread, which he also
took. Further on he came to a room where a beautiful
young lady sat upon a couch; and she welcomed him joyfully,
and said, if he would set her free from the spell that
bound her, the kingdom should be his, if he would come
back in a year and marry her. Then she told him that
the well that held the Water of Life was in the palace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">(206)</span>
gardens; and bade him make haste, and draw what he
wanted before the clock struck twelve.</p>

<p>He went on; and as he walked through beautiful
gardens, he came to a delightful shady spot in which stood
a couch; and he thought to himself, as he felt tired, that
he would rest himself for awhile, and gaze on the lovely
scenes around him. So he laid himself down, and sleep
fell upon him unawares, so that he did not wake up till
the clock was striking a quarter to twelve. Then he
sprang from the couch dreadfully frightened, ran to the
well, filled a cup that was standing by him full of water,
and hastened to get away in time. Just as he was going
out of the iron door it struck twelve, and the door fell so
quickly upon him that it snapt off a piece of his heel.</p>

<p>When he found himself safe, he was overjoyed to think
that he had got the Water of Life; and as he was going
on his way homewards, he passed by the little dwarf, who,
when he saw the sword and the loaf, said, “You have made
a noble prize; with the sword you can at a blow slay whole
armies, and the bread will never fail you.” Then the prince
thought to himself, “I cannot go home to my father without
my brothers”; so he said, “My dear friend, cannot
you tell me where my two brothers are, who set out in
search of the Water of Life before me, and never came
back?” “I have shut them up by a charm between two
mountains,” said the dwarf, “because they were proud
and ill-behaved, and scorned to ask advice.” The prince
begged so hard for his brothers, that the dwarf at last set
them free, though unwillingly, saying, “Beware of them,
for they have bad hearts.” Their brother, however, was
greatly rejoiced to see them, and told them all that had
happened to him; how he had found the Water of Life,
and had taken a cup full of it; and how he had set a
beautiful princess free from a spell that bound her; and
how she had engaged to wait a whole year, and then to
marry him, and to give him the kingdom.</p>

<p>Then they all three rode on together, and on their way
home came to a country that was laid waste by war and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">(211)</span>
dreadful famine, so that it was feared all must die for want.
But the prince gave the king of the land the bread, and all
his kingdom ate of it. And he lent the king the wonderful
sword, and he slew the enemy’s army with it; and thus the
kingdom was once more in peace and plenty. In the same
manner he befriended two other countries through which
they passed on their way.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp80" id="image208">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/image208.png"><img class="halfpage" src="images/image208_small.png" alt="" title="He came to a room where a beautiful lady sat upon a couch"></a>

</figure>

<p>When they came to the sea, they got into a ship; and
during their voyage the two eldest said to themselves,
“Our brother has got the water which we could not find,
therefore our father will forsake us and give him the
kingdom, which is our right”; so they were full of envy
and revenge, and agreed together how they could ruin
him. Then they waited till he was fast asleep, and
poured the Water of Life out of the cup, and took it
for themselves, giving him bitter sea-water instead.</p>

<p>When they came to their journey’s end, the youngest
son brought his cup to the sick king, that he might drink
and be healed. Scarcely, however, had he tasted the
bitter sea-water when he became worse even than he was
before; and then both the elder sons came in, and blamed
the youngest for what he had done; and said that he
wanted to poison their father, but that they had found
the Water of Life, and had brought it with them. He
no sooner began to drink of what they brought him,
than he felt his sickness leave him, and was as strong and
well as in his younger days. Then they went to their
brother, and laughed at him, and said, “Well, brother,
you found the Water of Life, did you? You have had
the trouble and we shall have the reward. Pray, with
all your cleverness, why did not you manage to keep your
eyes open? Next year one of us will take away your
beautiful princess, if you do not take care. You had
better say nothing about this to our father, for he does
not believe a word you say; and if you tell tales, you
shall lose your life into the bargain: but be quiet, and
we will let you off.”</p>

<p>The old king was still very angry with his youngest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">(212)</span>
son, and thought that he really meant to have taken
away his life; so he called his court together, and asked
what should be done, and all agreed that he ought to be
put to death. The prince knew nothing of what was
going on, till one day, when the king’s chief huntsman
went a-hunting with him, and they were alone in the
wood together, the huntsman looked so sorrowful that
the prince said, “My friend, what is the matter with
you?” “I cannot and dare not tell you,” said he. But
the prince begged very hard, and said, “Only tell me
what it is, and do not think I shall be angry, for I will
forgive you.” “Alas!” said the huntsman, “the king
has ordered me to shoot you.” The prince started at
this, and said, “Let me live, and I will change dresses
with you; you shall take my royal coat to show to my
father, and do you give me your shabby one.” “With
all my heart,” said the huntsman; “I am sure I shall be
glad to save you, for I could not have shot you.” Then
he took the prince’s coat, and gave him the shabby one,
and went away through the wood.</p>

<p>Some time after, three grand embassies came to the
old king’s court, with rich gifts of gold and precious
stones for his youngest son; now all these were sent from
the three kings to whom he had lent his sword and loaf
of bread, in order to rid them of their enemy and feed
their people. This touched the old king’s heart, and he
thought his son might still be guiltless, and said to his
court, “O that my son were still alive! how it grieves
me that I had him killed!” “He is still alive,” said the
huntsman; “and I am glad that I had pity on him, and
saved him: for when the time came, I could not shoot
him, but let him go in peace, and brought home his royal
coat.” At this the king was overwhelmed with joy, and
made it known throughout all his kingdom, that if his son
would come back to his court he would forgive him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the princess was eagerly waiting till her
deliverer should come back; and had a road made leading
up to her palace all of shining gold; and told her courtiers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">(213)</span>
that whoever came on horseback, and rode straight up to
the gate upon it, was her true lover; and that they must
let him in: but whoever rode on one side of it, they must
be sure was not the right one; and that they must send
him away at once.</p>

<p>The time soon came, when the eldest brother thought
that he would make haste to go to the princess, and say
that he was the one who had set her free, and that he
should have her for his wife, and the kingdom with her.
As he came before the palace and saw the golden road,
he stopped to look at it, and he thought to himself, “It
is a pity to ride upon this beautiful road”; so he turned
aside and rode on the right-hand side of it. But when he
came to the gate, the guards, who had seen the road he
took, said to him, he could not be what he said he was,
and must go about his business.</p>

<p>The second prince set out soon afterwards on the same
errand; and when he came to the golden road, and his
horse had set one foot upon it, he stopped to look at it,
and thought it very beautiful, and said to himself, “What
a pity it is that anything should tread here!” Then he
too turned aside and rode on the left side of it. But
when he came to the gate the guards said he was not the
true prince, and that he too must go away about his
business; and away he went.</p>

<p>Now when the full year was come round, the third
brother left the forest in which he had lain hid for fear
of his father’s anger, and set out in search of his betrothed
bride. So he journeyed on, thinking of her all the way,
and rode so quickly that he did not even see what the
road was made of, but went with his horse straight over
it; and as he came to the gate it flew open, and the
princess welcomed him with joy, and said he was her
deliverer, and should now be her husband and lord of the
kingdom. When the first joy at their meeting was over,
the princess told him she had heard of his father having
forgiven him, and of his wish to have him home again:
so, before his wedding with the princess, he went to visit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">(214)</span>
his father, taking her with him. Then he
told him everything; how his brothers had
cheated and robbed him, and yet that he had
borne all these wrongs for the love of his
father. And the old king was very angry, and
wanted to punish his wicked sons; but they
made their escape, and got into a ship and
sailed away over the
wide sea, and where
they went to
nobody knew
and nobody
cared.</p>

<p>And now
the old
king gathered
together his
court, and
asked all his kingdom to come
and celebrate the wedding of his son and the
princess. And young and old, noble and
squire, gentle and simple, came at once on the
summons; and among the rest came the
friendly dwarf, with the sugarloaf hat,
and a new scarlet cloak.</p>

<p>A Dwarf from Sweden was the next to be invited
to the stool, and sitting down he began to
tell how a troll was enabled to do a kindly
service to a poor lad who had saved him
from a fierce werewolf.</p>

<p>“My story,” he said, “shall be called</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="the_trolls_hammer">The Troll’s Hammer</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent">There was once a great famine
in the country; the poor could
not procure the necessaries of
life, and even the rich suffered
great privation. At that time
a poor peasant dwelt out on
the heath. One day he said
to his son, that he could no
longer support him, and that
he must go out in the world,
and provide for himself. Niels,
therefore, left home and wandered forth.</p>

<p>Towards evening he found himself in a large forest, and
climbed up into a tree, lest the wild beasts might do him
harm during the night. When he had slept about an hour
or perhaps more, a little man came running towards the
tree. He was hunch-backed, had crooked legs, a long
beard, and a red cap on his head. He was pursued by a
werewolf, which attacked him just under the tree in which
Niels was sitting. The little man began to scream; he bit
and scratched, and defended himself as well as he could,
but all to no purpose, the werewolf was his master, and
would have torn him in pieces, if Niels had not sprung
down from the tree, and come to his assistance. As soon
as the werewolf saw that he had two to contend with, he
was afraid, and fled back into the forest.</p>

<p>The Troll then said to Niels: “Thou hast preserved my
life, and done me good service; in return I will also give
thee something that will be beneficial to thee. See! here is
a hammer, and all the smith’s work which thou doest with it,
no one shall be able to equal. Continue thy way, and things
will go better than thou thinkest.<span id="cor215">”</span> When the Troll had
spoken these words, he sank into the ground before Niels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">(216)</span></p>

<p>The next day the boy wandered on, until he came to
the neighbourhood of the royal palace, and here he
engaged himself to a smith.</p>

<p>Now it just happened, that a few days previously a thief
had broken into the king’s treasury and stolen a large bag
of money. All the smiths in the city were, therefore, sent
for to the palace, and the king promised that he who could
make the best and securest lock, should be appointed court
locksmith, and have a considerable reward into the bargain.
But the lock must be finished in eight days, and
so constructed that it could not be picked by any one.</p>

<p>When the smith, with whom Niels lived, returned home
and related this, the boy thought he should like to try
whether his hammer really possessed those qualities which
the Troll had said. He therefore begged his master to
allow him to make a lock, and promised that it should be
finished by the appointed time. Although the smith had
no great opinion of the boy’s ability, he, nevertheless,
allowed him to make the trial. Niels then requested
to have a separate workshop, locked himself in, and then
began hammering the iron. One day went, and then
another, and the master began to be inquisitive; but
Niels let no one come in, and the smith was obliged
to remain outside, and peep through the <span id="cor216">key-hole</span>. The
work, however, succeeded far better than the boy himself
had expected; and, without his really knowing how it
came to pass, the lock was finished on the evening of the
third day.</p>

<p>The following morning he went down to his master and
asked him for some money. “Yesterday I worked hard,”
said he, “and to-day I will make myself merry.” Hereupon
he went out of the city, and did not return to the
workshop till late in the evening. The next day he did
the same, and idled away the rest of the week. His
master was, consequently, very angry, and threatened to
turn him away, unless he finished his work at the appointed
time. But Niels told him to be quite easy, and
engaged that his lock should be the best. When the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">(219)</span>
day arrived, Niels brought his work forth, and carried it
up to the palace, and it appeared that his lock was so
ingenious and delicately made, that it far excelled all
the others. The consequence was, that Niels’ master
was acknowledged as the most skilful, and received the
promised office and reward.</p>

<div class="chapter fullpage">
<figure class="figcenter illowp40 fullpage" id="image217">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/image217.png"><img class="fullpage" src="images/image217_small.png" alt="" title="See here is a hammer"></a>
</figure>
</div>

<p>The smith was delighted, but he took good care not to
confess to any one who it was that had made the curious
lock. He now received one work after another from the
king, and let Niels do them all, and he soon became a
wealthy man.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the report spread from place to place
of the ingenious lock the king had got for his treasury.
Travellers came from a great distance to see it, and it
happened that a foreign king came also to the palace.
When he had examined the work for a long time, he
said, that the man who could make such a lock deserved
to be honoured and respected. “But however good a
smith he may be,” added the king, “I have got his
master at home.” He continued boasting in this manner,
till at length the king offered to wager with him which
could execute the most skilful piece of workmanship.
The smiths were sent for, and the two kings determined
that each smith should make a knife. He who won was
to have a considerable reward. The smith related to
Niels what had passed, and desired him to try whether
he could not make as good a knife as he had a lock.
Niels promised that he would, although his last work had
not benefited him much. The smith was in truth an
avaricious man, and treated him so niggardly, that at times
he had not enough to eat and drink.</p>

<p>It happened one day, as Niels was gone out to buy
steel to make the knife, that he met a man from his own
village, and, in the course of conversation, learnt from
him that his father went begging from door to door, and
was in great want and misery. When Niels heard this he
asked his master for some money to help his father; but
his master answered, that he should not have a shilling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">(220)</span>
before he had made the knife. Hereupon Niels shut
himself up in the workshop, worked a whole day, and, as
on the former occasion, the knife was made without his
knowing how it happened.</p>

<p>When the day arrived on which the work was to be
exhibited, Niels dressed himself in his best clothes, and
went with his master up to the palace, where the two
kings were expecting them. The strange smith first
showed his knife. It was so beautiful, and so curiously
wrought, that it was a pleasure to look at it; it was, moreover,
so sharp and well tempered, that it could cut through
a millstone to the very centre, as if it had been only a
cheese, and that without the edge being in the least
blunted. Niels’ knife, on the contrary, looked very poor
and common. The king already began to think he had
lost his wager, and spoke harshly to the master-smith,
when his boy begged leave to examine the stranger’s
knife a little more closely. After having looked at it for
some time, he said: “This is a beautiful piece of workmanship
which you have made, and shame on those who
would say otherwise; but my master is, nevertheless, your
superior, as you shall soon experience.” Saying this, he
took the stranger’s knife and split it lengthwise from the
point to the handle with his own knife, as easily as one
splits a twig of willow. The kings could scarcely believe
their eyes; and the consequence was, that the Danish
smith was declared the victor, and got a large bag of
money to carry home with him.</p>

<p>When Niels asked for payment, his master refused to
give him anything, although he well knew that the poor
boy only wanted the money to help his father. Upon this
Niels grew angry, went up to the king, and related the
whole story to him, how it was he who had made both the
lock and the knife. The master was now called, but he
denied everything, and accused Niels of being an idle boy,
whom he had taken into his service out of charity and
compassion.</p>

<p>“The truth of this story we shall soon find out,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">(221)</span>
the king, who sided with the master. “Since thou sayest
it is thou who hast made this wonderful knife, and thy
master says it is he who has done it, I will adjudge each of
you to make a sword for me within eight days. He who
can make the most perfect one shall be my master-smith;
but he who loses, shall forfeit his life.”</p>

<p><span id="cor221a">Niels</span> was well satisfied with this agreement. He went
home, packed up all his things, and bade his master farewell.
The smith was now in great straits, and would
gladly have made all good again; but Niels appeared not
to understand him, and went his way, and engaged with
another master, where he cheerfully began to work on the
sword.</p>

<p>When the appointed day arrived, they both met at the
palace, and the master produced a sword of the most
elaborate workmanship that any one could wish to see,
besides being inlaid with gold, and set with precious
stones. The king was greatly delighted with it.</p>

<p>“Now, little Niels,” said he, “what dost thou say to
this sword?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” answered the boy, “it is not so badly made
as one might expect from such a bungler.”</p>

<p>“Canst thou show anything like it?” asked the king.</p>

<p>“I believe I can,” answered Niels.</p>

<p>“Well, produce thy sword; where is it?” said the king.</p>

<p>“I have it in my waistcoat pocket,” replied <span id="cor221b">Niels</span>.</p>

<p>Hereupon there was a general laugh, which was increased
when they saw the boy take a little packet out of
his waistcoat pocket. Niels opened the paper, in which
the blade was rolled up like a watch-spring. “Here
is my work,” said he, “will you just cut the thread,
master?”</p>

<p>The smith did it willingly, and in a moment the blade
straightened itself and struck him in the face.</p>

<p><span id="cor221c">Niels</span> took out of his other pocket a hilt of gold, and
screwed it fast to the blade; then presented the sword to
the king; and all present were obliged to confess that they
never before had seen such matchless workmanship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">(222)</span></p>

<p>Niels was unanimously declared the victor, and the
master was obliged to acknowledge that the boy had made
both the lock and the knife.</p>

  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/image222a.png"><img class="w100" src="images/image222a_small.png" alt="" title="The blade struck him in the face"></a>
</figure>

<p>The king in his indignation would have had
the master executed, if the boy had not begged
for mercy on the culprit. Niels received
a handsome
reward from the
king, and from that
day all the work from
the palace was intrusted
to him. He
took his old father to
reside with him, and
lived in competence and happiness till his death.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>When the Swedish Troll had gone back to his place after
telling with much self-satisfaction how one of his fellows
had befriended the poor apprentice, a Norwegian fairy came
forward to tell how three of her companions had similarly
served a young princess, and she named her story</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">There was once a king’s son and a king’s daughter who
dearly loved each other. The young princess was good and
fair, and well spoken of by all, but her disposition was
more inclined to pleasure and dissipation than to handiworks
and domestic occupations. To the old queen this
appeared very wrong, and she said she would have no
one for a daughter-in-law that was not as skilled in such
matters as she herself had been in her youth. She therefore
opposed the prince’s marriage in all sorts of ways.</p>

<p>As the queen would not recall her words, the prince
went to her and said, it would be well to make a trial
whether the princess were not as skilful as the queen
herself. This seemed to every one a very rash proposal,
seeing that the prince’s mother was a very diligent,
laborious person, and span and sewed and wove both
night and day, so that no one ever saw her like. The
prince, however, carried his point; the fair princess was
sent into the maiden’s bower, and the queen sent her a
pound of flax to spin. But the flax was to be spun ere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">(224)</span>
dawn of day, otherwise the damsel was never more to
think of the prince for a husband.</p>

<p>When left alone the princess found herself very ill at
ease; for she well knew that she could not spin the
queen’s flax, and yet trembled at the thought of losing
the prince, who was so dear to her. She therefore
wandered about the apartment and wept, incessantly
wept. At this moment the door was opened very softly,
and there stepped in a little, little woman of singular
appearance and yet more singular manners. The little
woman had enormously large feet, at which every one
who saw her must be wonderstruck. She greeted the
princess with: “Peace be with you!” “And peace
with you!” answered the princess. The old woman then
asked: “Why is the fair damsel so sorrowful to-night?”
The princess answered: “I may well be sorrowful. The
queen has commanded me to spin a pound of flax: if I
have not completed it before dawn, I lose the young prince
whom I love so dearly.” The old woman then said: “Be
of good cheer, fair maiden; if there is nothing else, I can
help you; but then you must grant me a request which I
will name.” At these words the princess was overjoyed,
and asked what it was the old woman desired. “I am
called,” she said, “Mother Bigfoot; and I require for my
aid no other reward than to be present at your wedding.
I have not been at a wedding since the queen your mother-in-law
stood as bride.” The princess readily granted her
desire, and they parted. The princess then lay down to
sleep, but could not close her eyes the whole livelong
night.</p>

<p>Early in the morning, before dawn, the door was opened,
and the little woman again entered. She approached the
king’s daughter and handed to her a bundle of yarn, as
white as snow and as fine as a cobweb, saying, “See!
such beautiful yarn I have not spun since I span for the
queen, when she was about to be married; but that was
long, long ago.” Having so spoken the little woman disappeared,
and the princess fell into a refreshing slumber<span id="cor224">,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">(225)</span>
but</span> she had not slept long when she was awakened by the
old queen, who was standing by her bed, and who asked
her whether the flax were all spun. The princess said that
it was, and handed the yarn to her. The queen must
needs appear content, but the princess could not refrain
from observing that her apparent satisfaction did not proceed
from good-will.</p>

<p>Before the day was over, the queen said she would put
the princess to yet another proof. For this purpose she
sent the yarn to the maiden-bower together with a yarn-roll
and other implements, and ordered the princess to
weave it into a web; but which must be ready before
sunrise; if not, the damsel must never more think of the
young prince.</p>

<p>When the princess was alone, she again felt sad at heart;
for she knew that she could not weave the queen’s yarn,
and yet less reconcile herself to the thought of losing the
prince to whom she was so dear. She therefore wandered
about the apartment and wept bitterly. At that moment
the door was opened softly, softly, and in stepped a very
little woman, of singular figure and still more singular
manners. The little woman had an enormously large
back, so that every one who saw her must be struck
with astonishment. She, too, greeted the princess with:
“Peace be with you!” and received for answer: “Peace
with you!” The old woman said: “Why is the fair
damsel so sad and sorrowful?” “I may well be sorrowful,”
answered the princess. “The queen has commanded
me to weave all this yarn into a web; and if I have not
completed it by the morning before sunrise, I shall lose
the prince, who loves me so dearly.” The woman then
said: “Be comforted, fair damsel; if it is nothing more,
I will help you. But then you must consent to one condition,
which I will name to you.” At these words the
princess was highly delighted, and asked what the condition
might be. “I am called Mother Bigback, and I
desire no other reward than to be at your wedding. I
have not been to any wedding since the queen your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">(226)</span>
mother-in-law stood as bride.” The king’s daughter readily
granted this request, and the little woman departed. The
princess then lay down to sleep, but was unable to close
her eyes the whole night.</p>

<p>In the morning, before daybreak, the door was opened
and the little woman entered. She approached the princess,
and handed to her a web white as snow and close as a skin,
so that its like was never seen. The old woman said:
“See! such even threads I have never woven since I wove
for the queen, when she was about to be married; but that
was long, long ago.” The woman then disappeared, and the
princess fell into a short slumber, but from which she was
roused by the old queen, who stood by her bed, and inquired
whether the web were ready. The princess told her
that it was, and handed to her the beautiful piece of weaving.
The queen must now appear content for the second time;
but the princess could easily see that she was not so from
good-will.</p>

<p>The king’s daughter now flattered herself that she should
be put to no further trial; but the queen was of a different
opinion; for she shortly after sent the web down to the
maiden-bower with the message, that the princess should
make it into shirts for the prince. The shirts were to be
ready before sunrise, otherwise the damsel must never hope
to have the young prince for a husband.</p>

<p>When the princess was alone, she felt sad at heart; for
she knew that she could not sew the queen’s web, and yet
could not think of losing the king’s son, to whom she was
so dear. She therefore wandered about the chamber, and
shed a flood of tears. At this moment, the door was softly,
softly opened, and in stepped a very little woman of most
extraordinary appearance and still more extraordinary
manners. The little woman had an enormously large
thumb, so that every one who saw it must be wonderstruck.
She also greeted the princess with: “Peace be
with you,” and likewise received for answer: “Peace with
you.” She then asked the young damsel why she was so
sad and lonely. “I may well be sad,” answered the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">(227)</span>
princess. “The queen has commanded me to make this
web into shirts for the king’s son; and if I have not
finished them to-morrow before sunrise, I shall lose my
beloved prince, who holds me so dear.” The woman
then said: “Be of good cheer, fair maiden; if it is
nothing more, I can help you. But then you must
agree to a condition, which I will mention.” At these
words the princess was overjoyed, and asked the little
woman what it was she wished. “I am,” answered she,
“called Mother Bigthumb, and I desire no other reward
than that I may be present at your wedding. I have not
been at a wedding since the queen your mother-in-law stood
as bride.” The princess willingly assented to this condition,
and the little woman departed. But the princess lay
down to sleep, and slept so soundly that she did not dream
even once of her dear prince.</p>

<p>Early in the morning, before the sun had risen, the door
was opened, and the little woman entered. She approached
the bed, awakened the princess, and gave her some shirts
that were sewed and stitched so curiously that their like
was never seen. The old woman said: “See! so beautifully
as this I have not sewn since I sewed for the queen,
when she was about to stand as bride. But that was long,
long ago.” With these words the little woman disappeared;
for the queen was then at the door, being just
come to inquire whether the shirts were ready. The king’s
daughter said that they were, and handed her the beautiful
work. At the sight of them the queen was so enraged that
her eyes flashed with fury. She said: “Well! take him
then. I could never have imagined that thou wast so
clever as thou art.” She then went her way, slamming the
door after her.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp20" id="image228">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/image228.png"><img class="w100" src="images/image228_small.png" alt="" title="Mother Bigfoot"></a>
</figure>

<p>The king’s son and the king’s daughter were now to be
united, as the queen had promised, and great preparations
were made for the wedding. But the joy of the princess
was not without alloy, when she thought of the singular
guests that were to be present. When some time had
elapsed, and the wedding was being celebrated in the good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">(228)</span>
old fashion, yet not one of the little old women appeared;
although the bride looked about in every direction. At
length, when it was growing late, and the guests were going
to table, the princess discerned the three
little women, as they sat in a corner of the
dining hall, at a table by themselves. At
the same moment the king stepped up to
them, and inquired who they
were, as he had never seen
them before. The eldest
of the three answered: “I
am called Mother Bigfoot,
and have such large
feet because I have
been obliged to sit
spinning so much in
my time.” “Oho!”
said the king, “if
such be the consequence,
my son’s
wife shall never spin
another thread.”
Then turning to the
second little woman,
he inquired the
cause of her uncommon
appearance.
The old woman answered:
“I am
called Mother Bigback,
and am so
broad behind because I have been obliged to sit weaving so
much in my time.” “Oho!” said the king, “then my son’s
wife shall weave no more.” Lastly, turning to the third
old woman, he asked her name; when Mother Bigthumb,
rising from her seat, told him that she had got so large
a thumb because she had sewed so much in her time.
“Oho!” said the king, “then my son’s wife shall never sew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">(231)</span>
another stitch.” Thus the fair princess obtained the king’s
son, and also escaped from spinning, and weaving, and
sewing for all the rest of her life.</p>

</div>

<p>When the wedding was over, the three little women went
their way, and no one knew whither they went, nor whence
they came. The prince lived happy and content with his
consort, and all passed on smoothly and peaceably; only
the princess was not so industrious as her strict mother-in-law.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The fairies are always glad when people do not find out
who it is that has benefited them,—for of course Mother
Bigfoot, Mother Bigback, and Mother Bigthumb were
really fairies in disguise,—and were therefore pleased at
the end of the Norwegian fairy’s tale.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Titania, and of course her word was law,
“I think I should like a song. Nymphidia, sing to us.”
Nymphidia at once stood up on the stool and all the
Queen’s maids of honour stood around it as they sang</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="the_three_sneezes">The Three Sneezes</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Billy MacDaniel was once as likely a young man as ever
shook his brogue at a patron, emptied a quart, or handled
a shillelagh; fearing for nothing but the want of drink;
caring for nothing but who should pay for it; and thinking
of nothing but how to make fun over it: drunk or sober,
a word or a blow was ever the way with Billy MacDaniel;
and a mighty easy way it is of either getting into or of
ending a dispute. More is the pity that, through the
means of his thinking, and fearing, and caring for nothing,
this same Billy MacDaniel fell into bad company; for
surely the good people are the worst of all company any
one could come across.</p>

<p>It so happened that Billy was going home one clear frosty
night not long after Christmas; the moon was round and
bright; but although it was as fine a night as heart could
wish for, he felt pinched with the cold. “By my word,”
chattered Billy, “a drop of good liquor would be no bad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">(235)</span>
thing to keep a man’s soul from freezing in him; and I
wish I had a full measure of the best.”</p>

<p>“Never wish it twice, Billy,” said a little man in a three-cornered
hat, bound all about with gold lace and with great
silver buckles in his shoes, so big that it was a wonder how
he could carry them, and he held out a glass as big as himself,
filled with as good liquor as ever eye looked on or lip
tasted.</p>

<p>“Success, my little fellow,” said Billy MacDaniel, nothing
daunted, though well he knew the little man to belong to
the good people; “here’s your health, any way, and thank
you kindly; no matter who pays for the drink”; and he
took the glass and drained it to the very bottom without
ever taking a second breath to it.</p>

<p>“Success,” said the little man; “and you’re heartily
welcome, Billy; but don’t think to cheat me as you have
done others,—out with your purse and pay me like a
gentleman.”</p>

<p>“Is it I pay you?” said Billy; “could I not just
take you up and put you in my pocket as easily as a
blackberry.”</p>

<p>“Billy MacDaniel,” said the little man, getting very
angry, “you shall be my servant for seven years and a
day, and that is the way I will be paid; so make ready
to follow me.”</p>

<p>When Billy heard this he began to be very sorry for
having used such bold words towards the little man; and
he felt himself, yet could not tell how, obliged to follow
the little man the livelong night about the country, up and
down, and over hedge and ditch, and through bog and
brake without any rest.</p>

<p>When morning began to dawn, the little man turned
round to him and said, “You may now go home, Billy,
but on your peril don’t fail to meet me in the Fort-field
to-night; or if you do it may be the worse for you in the
long-run. If I find you a good servant you will find me
an indulgent master.”</p>

<p>Home went Billy MacDaniel; and though he was tired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">(236)</span>
and weary enough, never a wink of sleep could he get for
thinking of the little man; but he was afraid not to do his
bidding, so up he got in the evening, and away he went to
the Fort-field. He was not long there before the little man
came towards him and said, “Billy, I want to go a long
journey to-night; so saddle one of my horses, and you
may saddle another for yourself, as you are to go along
with me, and may be tired after your walk last night.”</p>

<p>Billy thought this very considerate of his master, and
thanked him accordingly: “But,” said he, “if I may be
so bold, sir, I would ask which is the way to your stable,
for never a thing do I see but the fort here, and the old
thorn tree in the corner of the field, and the stream
running at the bottom of the hill, with the bit of bog over
against us.”</p>

<p>“Ask no questions, Billy,” said the little man, “but go
over to that bit of bog, and bring me two of the strongest
rushes you can find.”</p>

<p>Billy did accordingly, wondering what the little man
would be at; and he picked out two or three of the
stoutest rushes he could find, with a little bunch of brown
blossom stuck at the side of each, and brought them back
to his master.</p>

<p>“Get up, Billy,” said the little man, taking one of the
rushes from him and striding across it.</p>

<p>“Where shall I get up, please your honour?” said Billy.</p>

<p>“Why, upon horseback, like me, to be sure,” said the
little man.</p>

<p>“Is it after making a fool of me you’d be,” said Billy,
“bidding me get a <span id="cor236">horseback</span> upon that bit of a rush?
Maybe you want to persuade me that the rush I pulled
but while ago out of the bog over there is a horse?”</p>

<p>“Up! Up! and no words,” said the little man, looking
very angry; “the best horse you ever rode was but a fool
to it.” So Billy, thinking all this was in joke, and fearing
to vex his master, straddled across the rush. “Borram!
Borram! Borram!” cried the little man three times
(which, in English, means to become great), and Billy did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">(237)</span>
the same after him: presently the rushes swelled up into
fine horses, and away they went full speed; but Billy, who
had put the rush between his legs, without much minding
how he did it, found himself sitting on horseback the wrong
way, which was rather awkward, with his face to the horse’s
tail; and so quickly had his steed started off with him that
he had no power to turn round, and there was therefore
nothing for it but to hold on by the tail.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp40" id="image237">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/image237.png"><img class="w100" src="images/image237_small.png" alt="" title="Billy found himself sitting on horseback the wrong way"></a>
</figure>

<p>At last they came to their journey’s end, and stopped at
the gate of a fine house: “Now, Billy,” said the little man,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">(238)</span>
“do as you see me do, and follow me close; but as you
did not know your horse’s head from his tail, mind that
your own head does not spin round until you can’t tell
whether you are standing on it or on your heels: for
remember that old liquor, though able to make a cat
speak, can make a man dumb.”</p>

<p>The little man then said some queer kind of words, out
of which Billy could make no meaning; but he contrived
to say them after him for all that; and in they both went
through the key-hole of the door, and through one key-hole
after another, until they got into the wine cellar, which
was well-stored with all kinds of wine.</p>

<p>The little man fell to drinking as hard as he could, and
Billy, no way disliking the example, did the same. “The
best of masters are you, surely,” said Billy to him; “no
matter who is the next; and well pleased will I be with
your service if you continue to give me plenty to drink.”</p>

<p>“I have made no bargain with you,” said the little man,
“and will make none; but up and follow me.”</p>

<p>Away they went through key-hole after key-hole; and
each mounting upon the rush which he left at the
hall door, scampered off, kicking the clouds before them
like snowballs, as soon as the words, “Borram, Borram,
Borram,” had passed their lips.</p>

<p>When they came back to the Fort-field, the little man
dismissed Billy, bidding him be there the next night at the
same hour. Thus did they go on, night after night, shaping
their course one night here, and another night there—sometimes
north, and sometimes east, and sometimes south, until
there was not a gentleman’s wine-cellar in all Ireland they
had not visited and could tell the flavour of every wine in
it as well—ay, better than the butler himself.</p>

<p>One night when Billy MacDaniel met the little man as
usual in the Fort-field, and was going to the bog to fetch
the horses for their journey, his master said to him, “Billy,
I shall want another horse to-night, for maybe we may bring
back more company than we take.” So Billy, who now
knew better than to question any order given to him by his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">(239)</span>
master, brought a third rush much wondering who it might
be that would travel back in their company, and whether
he was about to have a fellow-servant. “If I have,”
thought Billy, “he shall go and fetch the horses from the
bog every night; for I don’t see why I am not, every inch
of me, as good a gentleman as my master.”</p>

<p>Well, away they went, Billy leading the third horse, and
never stopped until they came to a snug farmer’s house in
the county Limerick, close under the old castle of Carrigogunniel,
that was built they say, by the great Brian Boru.
Within the house there was great carousing going forward,
and the little man stopped outside for some time to listen;
then turning round all of a sudden said, “Billy, I will be
a thousand years old to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“God bless us, sir,” said Billy, “will you?”</p>

<p>“Don’t say these words again, Billy,” said the little man,
“or you will be my ruin for ever. Now, Billy, as I will be
a thousand years in the world to-morrow, I think it is full
time for me to get married.”</p>

<p>“I think so too, without any kind of doubt at all,” said
Billy, “if ever you mean to marry.”</p>

<p>“And to that purpose,” said the little man, “have I
come all the way to Carrigogunniel; for in this house,
this very night, is young Darby Riley going to be married
to Bridget Rooney; and as she is a tall and comely girl
and has come of decent people, I think of marrying her
myself and taking her off with me.”</p>

<p>“And what will Darby Riley say to that?” said Billy.</p>

<p>“Silence,” said the little man, putting on a mighty
severe look: “I did not bring you here with me to ask
questions;” and without holding further argument, he
began saying the queer words which had the power of
passing him through the key-hole as free as air, and which
Billy thought himself mighty clever to be able to say after
him.</p>

<p>In they both went; and for the better viewing the
company, the little man perched himself up as nimbly as a
cock sparrow upon one of the big beams which went across<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">(240)</span>
the house over all their heads, and Billy did the same
upon another facing him; but not being much accustomed
to roosting in such a place, his legs hung down as untidy
as may be, and it was quite clear he had not taken pattern
after the way in which the little man had bundled himself
up together. If the little man had been a tailor all his
life he could not have sat more contentedly upon his
haunches.</p>

<p>There they were, both master and man, looking down
upon the fun that was going forward; and under them
were the priest and piper, and the father of Darby Riley,
with Darby’s two brothers and his uncle’s son; and they
were both the father and the mother of Bridget Rooney,
and proud enough the old couple were that night of their
daughter, as good right they had; and her four sisters,
with bran new ribbons in their caps, and her three brothers
all looking as clean and as clever as any three boys in
Munster, and there were uncles and aunts, and gossips and
cousins enough besides to make a full house of it; and
plenty was there to eat and drink on the table for every
one of them, if they had been double the number.</p>

<p>Now it happened, just as Mrs Rooney had helped his
reverence to the first cut of the pig’s head which was
placed before her, beautifully bolstered up with white
savoys, that the bride gave a sneeze, which made every one
at table start, but no one said, “God bless us.” All
thinking that the priest would have done so, as he ought if
he had done his duty, no one wished to take the word out
of his mouth, which unfortunately was pre-occupied with
pig’s head and greens. And after a moment’s pause the
fun and merriment of the bridal feast went on without the
pious benediction.</p>

<p>Of this circumstance both Billy and his master were no
inattentive spectators from their exalted stations. “Ha,”
exclaimed the little man, throwing one leg from under him
with a joyous flourish, and his eye twinkled with a strange
light, whilst his eyebrows became elevated into the curvature
of Gothic arches—“Ha,” said he, leering down at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">(241)</span>
bride, and then up at Billy, “I have half of her now,
surely. Let her sneeze out twice more, and she is mine,
in spite of priest, mass-book, and Darby Riley.”</p>

<figure class="figright illowp30" id="image241">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/image241.png"><img class="w100" src="images/image241_small.png" alt="" title="Billy danced the Rinka"></a>
</figure>

<p>Again the fair Bridget
sneezed; but it was so
gently, and she blushed so
much, that few except the
little man took, or seemed
to take, any notice; and
no one thought of saying
“God bless us.”</p>

<p>Billy all this
time regarded the
poor girl with a
most rueful expression
of countenance;
for he
could not help
thinking what a
terrible thing it
was for a
nice young
girl of
nineteen,
with large blue eyes,
transparent skin, and
dimpled cheeks, suffused
with health and joy, to be
obliged to marry an ugly
little bit of a man, who
was a thousand years old
barring a day.</p>

<p>At this critical moment the bride gave a third sneeze,
and Billy roared out with all his might, “God save us.”
Whether this exclamation resulted from his soliloquy, or
from the mere force of habit, he never could tell exactly
himself; but no sooner was it uttered than the little man,
his face glowing with rage and disappointment, sprung from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">(242)</span>
the beam on which he had perched himself, and shrieking
out in the voice of a cracked bagpipe, “I discharge you
from my service, Billy MacDaniel—take <em>that</em> for your
wages,” gave poor Billy a most furious kick in the back,
which sent his unfortunate servant sprawling upon his face
and hands right in the middle of the supper table.</p>

<p>If Billy was astonished, how much more so was every
one of the company into which he was thrown with so
little ceremony. But when they heard his story, Father
Cooney laid down his knife and fork, and married the
young couple out of hand with all speed; and Billy
MacDaniel danced the Rinka at their wedding, and plenty
did he drink at it too, which was what he thought more of
than dancing.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Bottom was mighty glad when his story was over, for he
did not like the feeling that he could not get up from the
stool when he tried, and he did not like to hear how small
a voice he was speaking in; he would have liked to speak
big and show what a great fellow he was in that queer
company, but there he sat unable to move, and roaring as
gently as any sucking dove to use his own words. As
soon as he had got to the last word of his story he found
that he could get up and off he floundered
to his companions.</p>

<p>“Another <em>fairy</em> this time,” said King Oberon,
as though he had not altogether relished Bottom’s
story; “the Danish Elves have told us
nothing yet.”</p>

<p>At this, which was of course equal to
a command, a Danish Elf came forward,
seated himself and began to tell
about</p>

</figure>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="the_elf_hill">The Elf Hill</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Some lizards were nimbly running in and
out of the clefts in an old tree. They
understood each other very well, for they
all spoke lizard language.</p>

<p>“What a rumbling and grumbling is
going on inside the old Elf-hill,” said one
of the lizards. “I have not closed my eyes for the last
two nights for the noise. I might just as well be having
toothache, for all the sleep I get!”</p>

<p>“There is something up inside,” said the other lizard.
“They propped up the top of the hill on four red posts
till cockcrow this morning, to air it out thoroughly; and the
elf maidens have been learning some new dancing steps,
which they are always practising. There certainly must be
something going on.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I was talking to an earthworm of my acquaintance
about it,” said the third lizard. “He came straight up out
of the hill, where he had been boring into the earth for days
and nights. He had heard a good deal, for the miserable
creature can’t see, but it can feel its way, and plays the part
of eavesdropper to perfection. They are expecting visitors
in the Elf-hill, grand visitors; but who they are the earthworm
refused to say or perhaps he did not know. All the
will-o’-the-wisps are ordered for a procession of torches, as
it is called; and the silver and gold plate, of which there is
any amount in the hill, is all being polished up and put out
in the moonlight.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">(244)</span></p>

<p>“Whoever can the strangers be?” said all the lizards
together.</p>

<p>“What on earth is happening? Hark! what a humming
and buzzing!”</p>

<p>At this moment the Elf-hill opened, and an elderly elf-maiden
tripped out. She was hollow behind, but otherwise
quite attractively dressed. She was the old elf-king’s housekeeper,
and a distant relative. She wore an amber heart
upon her forehead. She moved her legs at a great pace,
“trip, trip.” Good heavens! how fast she tripped over the
ground; she went right down to the night-jar in the swamp.</p>

<p>“You are invited to the Elf-hill for to-night,” she said to
him. “But will you be so kind as to charge yourself with
the other invitations. You must make yourself useful in
other ways, as you don’t keep house yourself. We are
going to have some very distinguished visitors, goblins,
who always have something to say, and so the old elf-king
means to show what he can do.”</p>

<p>“Who is to be invited?” asked the night-jar.</p>

<p>“Well, everybody may come to the big ball, even human
beings, if they can only talk in their sleep, or do something
else after our fashion. But the choice is to be strictly
limited for the grand feast. We will only have the
most distinguished people. I have had a battle with the
Elf-king about it; because I hold that we mustn’t even
include ghosts. The merman and his daughters must be
invited first. I don’t suppose they care much about
coming on dry land, but I shall see that they each have a
wet stone to sit on, or something better; so I expect they
won’t decline this time. All the old demons of the first-class,
with tails, the River-god, and the wood-sprites. And
then I don’t think we can pass over the Grave-pig, the
Hell-horse, and the Church-grim, although they belong to
the clergy, who are not of our people; but that is merely
on account of their office, and they are closely connected
with us, and visit us very frequently.”</p>

<p>“Croak,” said the night-jar, and he flew off to issue the
invitations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">(245)</span></p>

<p>The elf-maidens had already begun to dance, and they
danced a scarf-dance, with scarves woven of mist and
moonshine; these have a lovely effect to those who care
for that kind of thing. The great hall in the middle of
the Elf-hill had been thoroughly polished up for the
occasion. The floor was washed with moonshine, and the
walls were rubbed over with witches’ fat, and this made
them shine with many colours, like a tulip petal. The
kitchen was full of frogs on spits, stuffed snake skins, and
salads of toad-stool spawn, mouse snouts and hemlock.
Then there was beer brewed by the marsh witch, and
sparkling saltpetre wine from the vaults. Everything of
the best, and rusty nails and church window panes
among the kickshaws.</p>

<p>The old Elf-king had his golden crown polished with
pounded slate-pencil, ay, and it was a head-boy’s slate-pencil
too, and they are not so easy to get. They hung
up fresh curtains in the bedroom, and fixed them with the
slime of snails. Yes, indeed, there was a humming and a
buzzing.</p>

<p>“Now we will fumigate, with horse-hair and pig’s bristles,
and then I can do no more!” said the old elf-servant.</p>

<p>“Dear father!” said the youngest of the daughters,
“are you not going to tell me who these grand strangers
are?”</p>

<p>“Well, well,” he said, “I suppose I must tell you now.
Two of my daughters must prepare themselves to be
married,—two will certainly make marriages. The old
Trold chieftain from Norway, that lives on the Dovrefield
among his many rock castles and fastnesses and gold
works, which are better than you would expect, is coming
down here with his two sons. They are coming to look
for wives. The old Trold is a regular honest Norwegian
veteran, straightforward and merry. I used to know him
in the olden days, when we drank to our good fellowship.
He came here to fetch a wife, but she is dead now. She
was a daughter of the king of the chalk cliffs at Möen.
As the saying is, ‘he took his wife on the chalk,’ that is,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">(246)</span>
bought her on tick. I am quite anxious to see the old
fellow. The sons, they say, are a pair of overgrown, ill-mannered
cubs; but perhaps they are not so bad; I daresay
they will improve as they grow older. See if you can’t
lick them into shape a bit.”</p>

<p>“And when do they come?” asked one of the daughters.</p>

<p>“That depends upon wind and weather,” said the Elf-king.
“They travel economically, and they will take their chance
of a ship. I wanted them to come round by Sweden, but
the old fellow can’t bring himself to that yet. He doesn’t
march with the times, but I don’t hold with that!”</p>

<p>At this moment two will-o’-the-wisps came hopping along,
one faster than the other, so of course one arrived before
the other.</p>

<p>“They are coming, they are coming!” they cried.</p>

<p>“Give me my crown, and let me stand in the moonlight,”
said the Elf-king.</p>

<p>The daughters raised their scarves and curtseyed to the
ground.</p>

<p>There stood the Trold chieftain from the Dovrefield; he
wore a crown of hardened icicles and polished fir-cones,
and besides this, he had on a bear-skin coat and snow-shoes.
His sons, on the other hand, had bare necks and wore no
braces, because they were strong men.</p>

<p>“Is that a hill?” asked the youngest of the brothers,
pointing to the Elf-hill. “We should call it a hole in
Norway.”</p>

<p>“Lads!” cried the old man, “holes go inwards, hills go
upwards? Haven’t you got eyes in your heads?”</p>

<p>The only thing that astonished them, they said, was that
they understood the language without any trouble.</p>

<p>“Don’t make fools of yourselves,” said the old man;
“one might think you were only half baked.”</p>

<p>Then they went into the Elf-hill, where the company was
of the grandest, although they had been got together in
such a hurry; you might almost say they had been blown
together. It was all charming, and arranged to suit everyone’s
taste. The merman and his daughters sat at table in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">(247)</span>
great tubs of water, and said it was just like being at home.
Everybody had excellent table manners, except the two
young Norwegian Trolds; they put their feet up on the
table, but then they thought anything they did was right.</p>

<p>“Take your feet out of the way of the dishes,” said the
old Trold, and they obeyed him, but not at once. They
tickled the ladies they took in to dinner with fir-cones out
of their pockets; then they pulled off their boots, so as to
be quite comfortable, and handed the boots to the ladies
to hold. Their father the old Trold chieftain, was very
different; he told no end of splendid stories about the
proud Norwegian mountains, and the waterfalls dashing
down in white foam with a roar like thunder. He told
them about the salmon leaping up against the rushing water,
when the nixies played with golden harps. Then he went
on to tell them about the sparkling winter nights when the
sledge bells rang and the lads flew over the ice with blazing
lights, the ice which was so transparent that you could see
the startled fish darting away under your feet. Yes, indeed,
he could tell stories, you could see and hear the things he
described; the saw mills going, the men and maids singing
their songs and dancing the merry Halling dance. Huzza!
All at once the old Trold gave the elf housekeeper a
smacking kiss, such a kiss it was, and yet they were not a
bit related. Then the elf-maidens had to dance, first plain
dancing, and then step dancing, and it was most becoming
to them. Then came a fancy dance.</p>

<p>Preserve us, how nimble they were on their legs, you
couldn’t tell where they began or where they ended, you
couldn’t tell which were arms and which were legs, they
were all mixed up together like shavings in a saw-pit. They
twirled round and round so often that it made the Hell-horse
feel quite giddy and unwell and he had to leave the table.</p>

<p>“Prrrrr!” said the old Trold. “There is some life in
those legs, but what else can they do besides dancing
and pointing their toes and all those whirligigs?”</p>

<p>“We will soon shew you!” said the Elf-king, and
he called out his youngest daughter; she was thin and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">(248)</span>
transparent as moonshine, and was the most ethereal
of all the daughters. She put a little white stick in her
mouth and vanished instantly; this was her accomplishment.</p>

<p>But the Trold said he did not like that accomplishment
in a wife, nor did he think his boys would appreciate it.
The second one could walk by her own side as if she
had a shadow, and no elves have shadows.</p>

<p>The third was quite different; she had studied in the
marsh witches’ brewery, and understood larding alder
stumps with glow-worms.</p>

<p>“She will be a good housewife,” said the Trold, and
then he saluted her with his eyes instead of drinking
her health, for he did not want to drink too much.</p>

<p>Now came the turn of the fourth; she had a big
golden harp to play, and when she touched the first
string everybody lifted up their left legs (for all the elfin
folk are left legged). But when she touched the second
string everybody had to do what she wished.</p>

<p>“She is a dangerous woman!” said the Trold, but both
his sons left the hill, for they were tired of it all.</p>

<p>“And what can the next daughter do?” asked the old
Trold.</p>

<p>“I have learnt to like the Norwegians,” she said, “and
I shall never marry unless I can go to Norway!”</p>

<p>But the smallest of the sisters whispered to the Trold,
“that is only because she once heard a song which said
that when the world came to an end, the rocks of Norway
would still stand, and that is why she wants to go there,
she is so afraid of being exterminated.”</p>

<p>“Ho, ho!” said the Trold, “so that slipped out. But
what can the seventh do?”</p>

<p>“The sixth comes before the seventh,” said the Elf-king,
for he could reckon, but she would not come
forward.</p>

<p>“I can only tell people the truth,” she said. “Nobody
cares for me, and I have enough to do in making my
winding sheet.”</p>

<p><span id="cor251">Now</span> came the seventh and last, what could she do?
Well she could tell stories as many as ever she liked.</p>

<p>“Here are my five fingers,” said the old Trold, “tell
me a story for each one.”</p>

<p>The elf-maiden took hold of his wrist, and he chuckled
and laughed, till he nearly choked. When she came to
the fourth finger, which had a gold ring on it, as if it
knew there was to be a betrothal, the Trold said, “Hold
fast what you have got, the hand is yours, I will have
you for a wife myself!” The elf-maiden said that the
stories about Guldbrand, the fourth finger, and little Peter
Playman, the fifth, had not yet been told.</p>

<p>“Never mind, keep those till winter. Then you shall
tell us about the fir, and the birch, and the fairy gifts,
and the tingling frost. You shall have every opportunity
of telling us stories; nobody up there does it yet. We
will sit in the Stone Hall, where the pine logs blaze,
and drink mead out of the golden horns of the old
Norwegian kings. The river god gave me a couple.
When we sit there the mountain sprite comes to pay
us a visit, and he will sing you the songs of the Sæter
girls. The salmon will leap in the waterfalls, and beat
against the stone wall, but it won’t get in. Ah, you may
believe me when I say that we lead a merry life there in
good old Norway. But where are the lads?”</p>

<p>Yes, where were the lads? They were running about
the fields, blowing out the will-o’-the-wisps, who came so
willingly for the torchlight procession.</p>

<p>“Why do you gad about out there?” said the Trold.
“I have taken a mother for you, now you can come and
take one of the aunts.”</p>

<p>But the lads said they would rather make a speech,
and drink toasts; they had no wish to marry. Then
they made their speeches, and drank toasts and tipped
their glasses up to shew that they had emptied them.
After that they pulled off their coats and went to sleep
on the table, to show that they were quite at home. But
the old Trold danced round and round the room with his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">(252)</span>
young bride, and exchanged boots with her, which was
grander than exchanging rings.</p>

<p>“There is the cock crowing!” said the old housekeeper.
“Now we must shut the shutters, so that the
sun may not burn us up.”</p>

<p>Then the hill closed up. But the lizards went on
running up and down the clefts of the tree; and they
said to each other, “Ah, how much I liked the old
Trold.”</p>

<p>“That reminds me of another story,” said the French
Fay, who had already told one story, but was evidently
ready and willing to tell another.</p>

<p>“We don’t want to hear two stories that are like each
other,” said King Oberon.</p>

<p>“Please your Majesty it is not like that which the
Danish Elf has just told, only his one reminded me of
mine,” answered the Fay.</p>

<p>“What is it about?” enquired the Queen who remembered
how much she had liked the dainty little
creature’s first tale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">(253)</span></p>

<p>“It is a story showing how that which is ugly may
become beautiful through love,” readily responded the
French Fay.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="riquet_with_the_tuft">Riquet with the Tuft</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Once upon a time there was a Queen who had a son, so
ugly and misshapen, that it was doubted for a long time
whether his form was really human. A fairy, who was
present at his birth, affirmed, nevertheless, that he would
be worthy to be loved, as he would have an excellent wit;
she added, moreover, that by virtue of the gift she had
bestowed upon him, he would be able to impart equal
intelligence to the one whom he loved best. All this
was some consolation to the poor Queen, who was much
distressed at having brought so ugly a little monkey into
the world. It is true that the child was no sooner able
to speak than he said a thousand pretty things, and that
in all his ways there was a certain air of intelligence, with
which everyone was charmed. I had forgotten to say that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">(255)</span>
he was born with a little tuft of hair on his head, and so
he came to be called Riquet with the Tuft; for Riquet was
the family name.</p>

<p>About seven or eight years later, the Queen of a neighbouring
kingdom had two daughters. The elder was fairer
than the day, and the Queen was so delighted, that it was
feared some harm might come to her from her great joy.
The same fairy who had assisted at the birth of little Riquet,
was present upon this occasion, and in order to moderate
the joy of the Queen, she told her that this little Princess
would have no gifts of mind at all, and that she would
be as stupid as she was beautiful. The Queen was greatly
mortified on hearing this, but, shortly after, she was even
more annoyed, when her second little daughter was born
and proved to be extremely ugly. “Do not distress yourself,
madam,” said the fairy to her, “your daughter will find
compensation, for she will have so much intelligence, that
her lack of beauty will scarcely be perceived.”</p>

<p>“Heaven send it may be so,” replied the Queen; “but
are there no means whereby a little more understanding
might be given to the elder, who is so lovely?” “I can
do nothing for her in the way of intelligence, madam,” said
the fairy, “but everything in the way of beauty; as, however,
there is nothing in my power I would not do to give
you comfort, I will bestow on her the power of conferring
beauty on any man or woman who shall please her.” As
these two Princesses grew up, their endowments also became
more perfect, and nothing was talked of anywhere but the
beauty of the elder, and the intelligence of the younger.
It is true that their defects also greatly increased with their
years. The younger became uglier every moment, and the
elder more stupid every day. She either made no answer
when she was spoken to, or else said something foolish.
With this she was so clumsy, that she could not even place
four pieces of china on a mantelshelf, without breaking one
of them, or drink a glass of water, without spilling half of
it on her dress. Notwithstanding the attraction of beauty,
the younger, in whatever society they might be, nearly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">(256)</span>
always bore away the palm from her sister. At first everyone
went up to the more beautiful, to gaze at and admire
her; but they soon left her for the cleverer one, to listen
to her many pleasant and amusing sayings; and people
were astonished to find that in less than a quarter of an
hour, the elder had not a soul near her, while all the company
had gathered round the younger. The elder, though
very stupid, noticed this, and would have given, without
regret, all her beauty, for half the sense of her sister.
Discreet as she was, the Queen could not help often reproaching
her with her stupidity, which made the poor
Princess ready to die of grief.</p>

<p>One day, when she had gone by herself into a wood,
to weep over her misfortune, she saw approaching her,
a little man of very ugly and unpleasant appearance, but
magnificently dressed. It was the young Prince Riquet
with the Tuft, who, having fallen in love with her from
seeing her portraits, which were sent all over the world,
had left his father’s kingdom that he might have the
pleasure of beholding her and speaking to her. Enchanted
at meeting her thus alone, he addressed her with all the
respect and politeness imaginable. Having remarked,
after paying her the usual compliments, that she was
very melancholy, he said to her, “I cannot understand,
madam, how a person so beautiful as you are can be
so unhappy as you appear; for, although I can boast of
having seen an infinite number of beautiful people, I can
say with truth that I have never seen one whose beauty
could be compared with yours.”</p>

<p>“You are pleased to say so, sir,” replied the Princess,
and there she stopped.</p>

<p>“Beauty,” continued Riquet, “is so great an advantage,
that it ought to take the place of every other, and,
possessed of it, I see nothing that can have power to
afflict one.”</p>

<p>“I would rather,” said the Princess, “be as ugly as you
are, and have intelligence, than possess the beauty I do,
and be so stupid as I am.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">(257)</span></p>

<p>“There is no greater proof of intelligence, madam, than
the belief that we have it not; it is the nature of that gift,
that the more we have, the more we believe ourselves to be
without it.”</p>

<p>“I do not know how that may be,” said the Princess,
“but I know well enough that I am very stupid, and
that is the cause of the grief that is killing me.”</p>

<p>“If that is all that troubles you, madam, I can easily
put an end to your sorrow.”</p>

<p>“And how would you do that?” said the Princess.</p>

<p>“I have the power, madam,” said Riquet with the Tuft,
“to give as much intelligence as it is possible to possess,
to the person whom I love best; as you, madam, are that
person, it will depend entirely upon yourself, whether or
not you become gifted with this amount of intelligence,
provided that you are willing to marry me.”</p>

<p>The Princess was struck dumb with astonishment, and
replied not a word.</p>

<p>“I see,” said Riquet with the Tuft, “that this proposal
troubles you, and I am not surprised, but I will give you
a full year to consider it.”</p>

<p>The Princess had so little sense, and at the same time
was so anxious to have a great deal, that she thought
the end of that year would never come; so she at once
accepted the offer that was made her. She had no
sooner promised Riquet with the Tuft that she would
marry him that day twelve months, than she felt herself
quite another person.</p>

<p>She found she was able to say whatever she pleased,
with a readiness past belief, and of saying it in a clever,
but easy and natural manner. She immediately began
a sprightly and well-sustained conversation with Riquet
with the Tuft, and was so brilliant in her talk, that
Riquet with the Tuft began to think he had given her
more wit than he had reserved for himself. On her
return to the palace, the whole Court was puzzled to
account for a change so sudden and extraordinary; for
the number of foolish things which they had been accustomed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">(258)</span>
to hear from her, she now made as many sensible
and exceedingly witty remarks. All the Court was in a
state of joy not to be described. The younger sister
alone was not altogether pleased, for, having lost her
superiority over her sister in the way of intelligence, she
now only appeared by her side as a very unpleasing-looking
person.</p>

<p>The King now began to be guided by his elder
daughter’s advice, and at times even held his Council in
her apartments. The news of the change of affairs was
spread abroad, and all the young princes of the neighbouring
kingdoms exerted themselves to gain her affection,
and nearly all of them asked her hand in marriage. She
found none of them, however, intelligent enough to please
her, and she listened to all of them, without engaging
herself to one.</p>

<p>At length arrived a Prince, so rich and powerful, so
clever and so handsome, that she could not help listening
willingly to his addresses. Her father, having perceived
this, told her that he left her at perfect liberty to choose
a husband for herself, and that she had only to make
known her decision. As the more intelligence we possess,
the more difficulty we find in making up our mind on
such a matter as this, she begged her father, after having
thanked him, to allow her time to think about it.</p>

<p>She went, by chance, to walk in the same wood in
which she had met Riquet with the Tuft, in order to
meditate more uninterruptedly over what she had to do.
While she was walking, deep in thought, she heard a
dull sound beneath her feet, as of many persons running
to and fro, and busily occupied. Having listened more
attentively, she heard one say, “Bring me that saucepan;”
another, “Give me that kettle;” another, “Put some
wood on the fire.” At the same moment the ground
opened, and she saw beneath her what appeared to be
a large kitchen, full of cooks, scullions, and all sorts of
servants necessary for the preparation of a magnificent
banquet. There came forth a band of about twenty to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">(261)</span>
thirty cooks, who went and established themselves in an
avenue of the wood, at a very long table, and who, each
with the larding-pin in his hand and the tail of his fur
cap over his ear, set to work, keeping time to a harmonious
song.</p>

<div class="chapter fullpage">
<figure class="figcenter illowp40 fullpage" id="image259">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/image259.png"><img class="fullpage" src="images/image259_small.png" alt="" title="There came forth a band of cooks"></a>
</figure>
</div>

<p>The Princess, astonished at this sight, asked the men
for whom they were working.</p>

<p>“Madam,” replied the chief among them, “for Prince
Riquet with the Tuft, whose marriage will take place
to-morrow.” The Princess, still more surprised than she
was before, and suddenly recollecting that it was just a
twelvemonth from the day on which she had promised
to marry Prince Riquet with the Tuft, was overcome with
trouble and amazement. The reason of her not having
remembered her promise was, that when she made it
she had been a very foolish person, and when she became
gifted with the new mind that the Prince had given
her, she had forgotten all her follies.</p>

<p>She had not taken another thirty steps, when Riquet
with the Tuft presented himself before her, gaily and
splendidly attired, like a Prince about to be married.
“You see, madam,” said he, “I keep my word punctually,
and I doubt not that you have come thither to keep
yours, and to make me, by the giving of your hand,
the happiest of men.”</p>

<p>“I confess to you, frankly,” answered the Princess,
“that I have not yet made up my mind on that matter,
and that I do not think I shall ever be able to do so
in the way you wish.” “You astonish me, madam,” said
Riquet with the Tuft. “I have no doubt I do,” said the
Princess; “and assuredly, had I to deal with a stupid
person, with a man without intelligence, I should feel
greatly perplexed. ‘A Princess is bound by her word,’
he would say to me, ‘and you must marry me, as you
have promised to do so.’ But as the person to whom
I speak is, of all men in the world, the one of greatest
sense and understanding, I am certain he will listen to
reason. You know that, when I was no better than a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">(262)</span>
fool, I nevertheless could not decide to marry you—how
can you expect, now that I have the mind which you
have given me, and which renders me much more difficult
to please than before, that I should take to-day a resolution
which I could not then? If you seriously thought
of marrying me, you did very wrong to take away my
stupidity, and so enable me to see more clearly than I
saw then.” “If a man without intelligence,” replied
Riquet with the Tuft, “who reproached you with your
breach of promise, might have a right, as you have just
intimated, to be treated with indulgence, why would you,
madam, that I should receive less consideration in a
matter which affects the entire happiness of my life?
Is it reasonable that persons of intellect should be in
a worse position than those that have none? Can you
assert this—you who have so much, and who so earnestly
desired to possess it? But let us come to the point, if
you please. Setting aside my ugliness, is there anything
in me that displeases you? Are you dissatisfied with
my birth, my understanding, my temper, or my manners?”</p>

<p>“Not in the least,” replied the Princess; “I admire
in you everything you have mentioned.”</p>

<p>“If that is so,” rejoined Riquet with the Tuft, “I shall
soon be happy, as you have it in your power to make me
the most pleasing looking of men.”</p>

<p>“How can that be done?” asked the Princess.</p>

<p>“It can be done,” said Riquet with the Tuft, “if you
love me sufficiently to wish that it should be. And, in
order, madam, that you should have no doubt about it,
know that the same fairy, who, on the day I was born,
endowed me with the power to give intelligence to the
person I chose, gave you also the power to render handsome
the man you should love, and on whom you should
wish to bestow this favour.”</p>

<p>“If such be the fact,” said the Princess, “I wish, with
all my heart, that you should become the handsomest and
most lovable Prince in the world, and I bestow the gift on
you to the fullest extent in my power.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">(263)</span></p>

<p>The Princess had no sooner pronounced these words
than Riquet with the Tuft appeared to her eyes, of all men
in the world, the handsomest, the best made, and most
attractive she had ever seen. There are some who assert
that it was not the spell of the fairy, but love alone that
caused the metamorphosis. They say that the Princess,
having reflected on the perseverance of her lover, on his
prudence, and on all the good qualities of his heart and
mind, no longer saw the deformity of his body, or the
ugliness of his features; that his hump appeared to her
nothing more than a good-natured shrug of his shoulders,
and that instead of noticing, as she had done, how badly
he limped, she saw in him only a certain lounging air,
which charmed her. They say also that his eyes, which
squinted, only seemed to her the more brilliant for this;
and that the crookedness of his glance was to her merely
expressive of his great love; and, finally, that his great
red nose had in it, to her mind, something martial and
heroic. However this may be, the Princess promised on
the spot to marry him, provided he obtained the consent
of the King, her father. The
King, having learned that his
daughter entertained a great regard
for Riquet with the Tuft,
whom he knew also to be a very
clever and wise Prince, received
him with pleasure as his son-in-law.
The wedding took place
the next morning, as Riquet
with the Tuft had foreseen, and
according to the orders which
he had given a long time before.</p>

<p>“That is delightful, but it is <em>much</em> too short,” said
Titania smilingly.</p>

<p>“It is better too short than too long,” answered
Oberon, “but perhaps the pretty little story-teller has

<p>“Let it be a longer one this time,” said Titania, “and

<h2 class="nobreak" id="the_benevolent_frog">The Benevolent Frog</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent">There was once a King who for many years had been engaged
in a war with his neighbours; a great number of
battles had been fought, and at last the enemy laid siege
to his capital. The King, fearing for the safety of the
Queen, begged her to retire to a fortified castle, which he
himself had never visited but once. The Queen endeavoured,
with many prayers and tears, to persuade
him to allow her to remain beside him and to share his
fate, and it was with loud cries of grief that she was put
into her chariot by the King to be driven away. He
ordered his guards, however, to accompany her, and
promised to steal away when possible to visit her. He
tried to comfort her with this hope, although he knew
that there was little chance of fulfilling it, for the castle
stood a long distance off, surrounded by a thick forest,
and only those who were well acquainted with the roads
could possibly find their way to it.</p>

<p>The Queen parted from her husband, broken-hearted at
leaving him exposed to the dangers of war; she travelled
by easy stages, in case the fatigue of so long a journey
should make her ill; at last she reached the castle, feeling
low-spirited and distressed. When sufficiently rested, she
walked about the surrounding country, but found nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">(266)</span>
to interest her or divert her thoughts. She saw only
far-spreading desert tracts on either side, which gave her
more pain than pleasure to look upon; sadly she gazed
around her, exclaiming at intervals, “What a contrast
between this place and that in which I have lived all
my life! If I stay here long I shall die! To whom
have I to talk in these solitudes? With whom can I
share my troubles? What have I done to the King
that he should banish me? He wishes me, it seems,
to feel the full bitterness of our separation, by exiling me
to this miserable castle.”</p>

<p>Thus she lamented; and although the King wrote daily to
her, and sent her good news of the progress of the siege, she
grew more and more unhappy, and at last determined that she
would return to him. Knowing, however, that the officers
who were in attendance upon her had received orders not to
take her back, unless the King sent a special messenger,
she kept her design secret, but ordered a small chariot to
be built for her, in which there was only room for one,
saying that she should like sometimes to accompany the
hunt. She drove herself, and followed so closely on the
hounds, that the huntsmen were left behind; by this
means she had sole command of her chariot, and could
get away whenever she liked. Her only difficulty was her
ignorance of the roads that traversed the forest; but she
trusted to the kindness of Providence to bring her safely
through it. She gave word that there was to be a great
hunt, and that she wished everybody to be there; she
herself would go in her chariot, and each was to follow
a different route, that there might be no possibility of
escape for the wild beasts. Everything was done according
to her orders. The young Queen, feeling sure that
she should soon see her husband again, dressed herself as
becomingly as possible; her hat was covered with feathers
of different colours, the front of her dress lavishly trimmed
with precious stones, and her beauty, which was of no
ordinary kind, made her seem, when so adorned, a
second Diana.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">(267)</span></p>

<p>While everybody was occupied with the pleasures of the
hunt, she gave rein to her horses, encouraged them with
voice and whip, and soon their quickened pace became a
gallop; then, taking the bit between their teeth, they flew
along at such a speed, that the chariot seemed borne by
the winds, and the eye could scarcely follow it. Too late
the poor Queen repented of her rashness: “What could
I have been thinking of?” she said. “How could I have
imagined that I should be able to control such wild and
fiery horses? Alas! what will become of me? What
would the King do if he knew the great danger I am in,
he who loves me so dearly, and who only sent me away
that I might be in greater safety! This is my gratitude
for his tender care!” The air resounded with her piteous
lamentations; she invoked Heaven, she called the fairies
to her assistance, but it seemed that all the powers had
abandoned her. The chariot was overthrown; she had
not sufficient strength to jump quickly enough to the
ground, and her foot was caught between the wheel and
the axle-tree; it was only by a miracle she was saved.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp40" id="image268">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/image268.png"><img class="w100" src="images/image268_small.png" alt="" title="Placing the queen on her back she carried her to her cave"></a>
</figure>

<p>She remained stretched on the ground at the foot of a
tree; her heart scarcely beat, she could not speak, and
her face was covered with blood. She lay thus for a long
time; when at last she opened her eyes, she saw, standing
near her, a woman of gigantic stature, clothed only in a
lion’s skin, with bare arms and legs, her hair tied up with
the dried skin of a snake, the head of which dangled over
her shoulders; in her hand was a club made of stone,
which served her as a walking-stick, and a quiver full of
arrows was fastened to her side. When the Queen caught
sight of this extraordinary figure, she felt sure that she
was dead, for she did not think it was possible that she
could be alive after such a terrible accident, and she said
in a low voice to herself, “I am not surprised that it is so
difficult to resolve to die, since what is to be seen in the
other world is so frightful.” The giantess, who overheard
her words, could not help laughing at the Queen’s idea
that she was dead. “Take courage<span id="cor267">,</span>” she said to her,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">(268)</span>
“for know that you are still among the living; but your
fate is none the less sad. I am the Fairy Lioness, whose
dwelling is near here; you must come and live with me.”
The Queen looked sorrowfully at her, and said, “If you
will be good enough, Madam Lioness, to take me back to
my castle, and tell the King what ransom you demand, he
loves me so dearly, that he will not refuse you even the
half of his kingdom.” “No,” replied the giantess, “I am
rich enough, but for some time past my lonely life has
seemed dull to me; you are intelligent, and will be able
perhaps to amuse me.” As she finished speaking, she
took the form of a lioness, and placing the Queen on her
back, she carried her to the depths of her cave, and there
rubbed her with a spirit which quickly healed the Queen’s
wounds. But what surprise and misery for the Queen to
find herself in this dreadful abode! It was only reached
by ten thousand steps, which led down to the centre of the
earth; there was no light but that shed by a number of
tall lamps, which were reflected in a lake of quicksilver.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">(269)</span>
This lake was covered with monsters, each hideous enough
to have frightened a less timid queen; there were owls,
screech-owls, ravens, and other birds of ill omen, filling the
air with discordant sounds; in the distance could be seen
rising a mountain whence flowed the sluggish waters of a
stream composed of all the tears shed by unhappy lovers,
from the reservoirs of their sad loves. The trees were
bare of leaves and fruit, the ground covered with marigolds,
briars, and nettles.</p>

<p>The food corresponded to the climate of this miserable
country; for a few dried roots, some horse-chestnuts, and
thorn-apples, were all that was provided by the Fairy
Lioness to appease the hunger of those who fell into her
hands.</p>

<p>As soon as the Queen was well enough to begin work,
the fairy told her she could build herself a hut, as she was
going to remain with her for the rest of her life. On
hearing this, the Queen could no longer restrain her tears:
“Alas, what have I done to you,” she cried, “that you
should keep me here? If my death, which I feel is near,
would give you pleasure, I pray you, kill me, it is all the
kindness I dare hope from you; but do not condemn me
to pass a long and melancholy life apart from my husband.”</p>

<p>The Lioness only scoffed at her, and told her that the
best thing she could do was to dry her tears, and try to
please her; that if she acted otherwise, she would be the
most miserable person in the world.</p>

<p>“What must I do then,” replied the Queen, “to soften
your heart?” “I am fond of fly-pasties,” said the
Lioness. “You must find means of procuring a sufficient
number of flies to make me a large and sweet-tasting
one.” “But,” said the Queen, “I see no flies here, and
even were there any, it is not light enough to catch them;
and if I were to catch some, I have never in my life made
pastry, so that you are giving me orders which it is
impossible for me to execute.” “No matter,” said the
pitiless Lioness; “that which I wish to have, I will have.”</p>

<p>The Queen made no reply: she thought to herself, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">(270)</span>
spite of the cruel fairy, that she had but one life to lose,
and in the condition in which she then was, what was
there to fear in death? Instead, therefore, of going in
search of flies, she sat herself down under a yew tree, and
began to weep and complain: “Ah, my dear husband,
what grief will be yours, when you go to the castle to
fetch me, and find I am not there; you will think that I
am dead, or faithless, and I would rather that you should
mourn the loss of my life, than that of my love; perhaps
someone will find the remains of my chariot in the
forest, and all the ornaments which I took with me to
please you; and when you see these, you will no longer
doubt that death has taken me; and how can I tell that
you will not give to another the heart’s love which you
have shared with me? But, at least, I shall not have
the pain of knowing this, since I am not to return to the
world.” She would have continued communing thus with
herself for a long time, if she had not been interrupted
by the dismal croaking of a raven above her head. She
lifted her eyes, and by the feeble light saw a large raven
with a frog in its bill, and about to swallow it. “Although
I see no help at hand for myself,” she said, “I will not
let this poor frog perish if I can save it; it suffers as
much in its way, as I do in mine, although our conditions
are so different,” and picking up the first stick she could
find, she made the raven drop its prey. The frog fell
to the ground, where it lay for a time half-stunned, but
finally recovering its froggish senses, it began to speak,
and said: “Beautiful Queen, you are the first benevolent
person that I have seen since my curiosity first brought
me here.” “By what wonderful power are you enabled
to speak, little Frog?” responded the Queen, “and what
kind of people do you see here? for as yet I have seen
none.” “All the monsters that cover the lake,” replied
the little Frog, “were once in the world; some on
thrones, some in high positions at court; there are even
here some royal ladies, who caused much strife and
bloodshed; it is they whom you see changed into leeches;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">(271)</span>
their fate condemns them to be here for a time, but none
of those who come return to the world better or wiser.”
“I can well understand,” said the Queen, “that many
wicked people together do not help to make each other
better; but you, my little Frog friend, what are you
doing here?” “It was curiosity which led me here,”
she replied. “I am half a fairy, my powers are restricted
with regard to certain things, but far-reaching in others;
if the Fairy Lioness knew that I was in her dominions,
she would kill me.”</p>

<p>“Whether fairy or half-fairy,” said the Queen, “I
cannot understand how you could have fallen into the
raven’s clutches and been nearly eaten.” “I can explain
it in a few words,” replied the Frog. “When I have my
little cap of roses on my head, I fear nothing, as in that
resides most of my power; unfortunately, I had left it
in the marsh, when that ugly raven pounced upon me;
if it had not been for you, madam, I should be no more;
and as you have saved my life, you have only to command,
and I will do all in my power to alleviate the sorrows
of your own.” “Alas! dear Frog,” said the Queen,
“the wicked fairy who holds me captive wishes me to
make her a fly-pasty; but there are no flies here; if there
were any, I could not see in the dim light to catch them;
I run a chance, therefore, of being killed by her blows.”</p>

<p>“Leave it to me,” said the Frog. “I will soon get
you some.” Whereupon the Frog rubbed herself over
with sugar, and more than six thousand of her frog
friends did likewise; then they repaired to a place where
the fairy kept a large store of flies, for the purpose of
tormenting some of her unhappy victims. As soon as
they smelt the sugar, they flew to it, and stuck to the
frogs, and these kind helpers returned at a gallop to
the Queen. There had never been such a fly-catching
before, nor a better pasty, than that the Queen made
for the fairy. The latter was greatly surprised when
the Queen handed it to her, and could not imagine how
she had been clever enough to catch the flies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">(272)</span></p>

<p>The Queen, finding herself exposed to the inclemencies
of the poisonous atmosphere, cut down some cypress
branches, wherewith to build herself a hut. The Frog
generously offered her services, and putting herself at the
head of all those who had gone to collect the flies, they
helped the Queen to build as pretty a little tenement as
the world could show. Scarcely, however, had she laid
herself down to rest, than the monsters of the lake,
jealous of her repose, came round her hut, and nearly
drove her distracted, by setting up a noise, more hideous
than any ever heard before.</p>

<p>She rose in fear and trembling and fled from the house:
this was exactly what the monsters desired. A dragon,
who had formerly been a tyrant of one of the finest
states of the Universe, immediately took possession of it.</p>

<p>The poor Queen tried to complain of the ill-treatment,
but no one would listen to her; the monsters laughed
and hooted at her, and the Fairy Lioness told her that
if she came again to deafen her with lamentations, she
would give her a sound thrashing. She was forced,
therefore, to hold her tongue, and to have recourse to
the Frog, who was the kindest body in the world. They
wept together; for as soon as she put on her cap of
roses, the Frog was able to laugh or weep like anyone
else. “I feel such an affection for you,” she said to the
Queen, “that I will re-build your house, even though I
drive all the monsters of the lake to despair.” She immediately
cut some wood, and the little rustic palace
of the Queen was so quickly reared, that she was able
to sleep in it that night. The Frog, who thought of
everything that was necessary for the Queen’s comfort,
made her a bed of wild thyme. When the wicked fairy
found out that the Queen did not sleep on the ground,
she sent for her: “What gods or men are they who
protect you?” she asked. “This land, watered only by
showers of burning sulphur, has never produced even a
leaf of sage; I am told, nevertheless, that sweet-smelling
herbs spring up beneath your feet!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">(273)</span></p>

<p>“I cannot explain it, madam,” said the Queen, “unless
the cause is due to the child I hope one day to have,
who will perhaps be less unhappy than I am.”</p>

<p>“What I now wish for,” said the fairy, “is a bunch
of the rarest flowers; see if this coming happiness you
speak of will obtain these for you. If you fail to get
them, blows will not fail to follow, for these I often give,
and know well how to administer.” The Queen began
to cry; such threats as these were anything but pleasant
to her, and she was in despair at the thought of the
impossibility of finding flowers.</p>

<p>She went back to her little house; her friend the Frog
came to her: “How unhappy you are!” she said to the
Queen. “Alas! who would not be so, dear friend? The
fairy has ordered a bunch of the most beautiful flowers,
and where am I to find them? You see what sort of
flowers grow here; my life, nevertheless, is at stake, if I
do not procure them for her.” “Dear Queen,” said the
Frog in tender tones, “we must try our best to get you
out of this difficulty. There lives a bat in this neighbourhood,
the only one with whom I have made acquaintance;
she is a good creature, and moves more quickly than I can;
I will give her my cap of roses, and aided by this, she will
be able to find you the flowers.” The Queen made a low
curtsey: for there was no possible way of embracing the
Frog. The latter went off without delay to speak to the
bat; a few hours later she returned, bearing under her
wings the most exquisite flowers. The Queen hurried
off with them to the fairy, who was more overcome
by surprise than before, unable to understand in what
miraculous way the Queen received help.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Queen was continually thinking by what
means she could escape. She confided her longing to the
Frog, who said to her, “Madam, allow me first to consult
my little cap, and we will then arrange matters according
to its advice.” She took her cap, placed it on some straw,
and then burned in front of it a few sprigs of juniper,
some capers, and two green peas; she then croaked five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">(274)</span>
times, and the ceremony being completed put on her cap
again, and began speaking like an oracle. “Fate, the
ruler of all things, forbids you to leave this place. You
will have a little Princess, more beautiful than Venus herself;
do not trouble yourself about anything else, time
alone can comfort you.” The Queen’s head drooped,
a few tears fell from her eyes, but she resolved to trust
her friend: “At least,” she said to her, “do not leave
me here alone; and befriend me when my little one is
born.” The Frog promised to remain with her, and comforted
her as best she could.</p>

<p>But it is now time to return to the King. While the
enemy kept him shut up in his capital, he could not continually
send messengers to the Queen. At last, however,
after several sorties, he obliged the besiegers to retire, and
he rejoiced at his success less on his own account, than
on that of the Queen, whom he could now bring back in
safety. He was in total ignorance of the disaster which
had befallen her, for none of his officers had dared to
tell him of it. They had been into the forest and found
the remains of the chariot, the runaway horses, and the
driving apparel which she had put on when going to find
her husband. As they were fully persuaded that she was
dead, and had been eaten by wild beasts, their only care
was to make the King believe that she had died suddenly.
On receiving this mournful intelligence, he thought
he should die of grief; he tore his hair, he wept
many tears, and gave vent to his bereavement in every
imaginable expression of sorrow, cries, sobs, and sighs.
For some days he would see no one, nor allow himself
to be seen; he then returned to his capital, and
entered on a long period of mourning, to which the
sorrow of his heart testified more sincerely than even
his sombre garments of grief. All the surrounding
kings sent their ambassadors charged with messages of
condolence; and when the ceremonies, indispensable
to these occasions, were over, he granted his subjects
a period of peace, exempting them from military service,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">(275)</span>
and helping them, in every possible way, to improve their
commerce.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp40" id="image275">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/image275.png"><img class="w100" src="images/image275_small.png" alt="" title="A little princess had been born to her"></a>
</figure>

<p>The Queen knew nothing of all this. Meanwhile a
little Princess had been born to her, as beautiful as the
Frog had predicted, to whom they gave the name of
Moufette. The Queen had great difficulty in persuading
the fairy to allow her to bring up the child, for so ferocious
was she, that she would have liked to eat it. Moufette,
a wonder of beauty, was now six months old; the Queen,
as she looked upon her with a tenderness mingled with
pity, continually said: “Ah! if your father could see
you, my poor little one, how delighted he would be! how
dear you would be to him! But even, already, maybe, he
has begun to forget me; he believes, no doubt, that we
are lost to him in death; and perhaps another fills the
place in his heart, that once was mine.”</p>

<p>These sorrowful reflections caused her many tears; the
Frog, who truly loved her, seeing her cry like this, said to
her one day: “If you would like me to do so, madam, I
will go and find the King, your husband; the journey is
long, and I travel but slowly; but, sooner or later, I shall
hope to arrive.” This proposal could not have been more
warmly received than it was; the Queen clasped her hands,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">(276)</span>
and made Moufette clasp hers too, in sign of the gratitude
she felt towards Madam Frog, for offering to undertake the
journey. She assured her that the King also would not be
ungrateful; “but,” she continued, “of what use will it be
to him to know that I am in this melancholy abode; it will
be impossible for him to deliver me from it?” “Madam,”
replied the Frog, “we must leave that to Heaven; we can
only do that which depends on ourselves.”</p>

<p>They said good-bye to one another; the Queen sent
a message to the King, written with her blood on a piece
of rag; for she possessed neither ink nor paper. She
begged him to give attention to everything the good Frog
told him, and to believe all she said, as she was bringing
him news of herself.</p>

<p>The Frog was a year and four days climbing up the ten
thousand steps which lead from the dark country, in which
she had left the Queen, up into the world; it took her
another year to prepare her equipage, for she had too much
pride to allow herself to appear at the Court like a poor,
common frog from the marshes. She had a little sedan-chair
made, large enough to hold two eggs comfortably;
it was covered on the outside with tortoise-shell, and lined
with lizard-skin; then she chose fifty maids of honour,
these were the little green frogs which hop about the
meadows; each was mounted on a snail, furnished with
a light saddle, and rode in style with the leg thrown over
the saddle-bow; several water-rats, dressed as pages, ran
before the snails, as her body-guard; in short, nothing so
pretty had ever been seen before, and to crown it all, her
cap of crimson roses, always fresh and in full bloom, suited
her in the most admirable manner. She was a bit of a
coquette in her way, so she felt obliged to add a little
rouge and a few patches; some said that she was painted
as were many ladies of that country, but inquiries into the
matter proved that this report had only been spread by
her enemies.</p>

<p>The journey lasted seven years, during which time the
poor Queen went through unspeakable pains and suffering,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">(277)</span>
and if it had not been for the beautiful Moufette,
who was a great comfort to her, she would have died a
hundred times over. This wonderful little creature could
not open her mouth or say a word, without filling her
mother with delight; indeed, everybody, with the exception
of the Fairy Lioness, was enchanted with her;
at last, when the Queen had lived six years in this horrible
place, the fairy said that, provided everything she killed
was given to her, she might go hunting with her.</p>

<p>The joy of the Queen at once more seeing the sun may
be imagined. So unaccustomed had she grown to its
light, that at first she thought it would blind her. As for
Moufette, she was so quick and intelligent, that even, at
five or six years of age, she never failed to hit her mark,
and so, in this way, the mother and daughter succeeded
in somewhat lessening the ferocity of the fairy.</p>

<p>The Frog travelled over mountains and valleys, never
stopping day or night; at last she drew near the capital,
where the King was in residence. She was surprised to
see dancing and festivity in every direction; there was
laughter and singing, and the nearer she got to the town,
the more joyous and jubilant the people seemed. Her
equipage caused great astonishment, everyone went after
it, and so large had the crowd become by the time she
had reached the town, that she had great difficulty in
making her way to the palace. Here everything was as
magnificent as possible, for the King, who had been a
widower for nine years, had at last yielded to the prayers
of his subjects, and was on the eve of marriage with a
Princess, less beautiful, it is true, than his wife, but not
the less agreeable for that.</p>

<p>The kind Frog, having descended from her sedan-chair,
entered the royal presence, followed by her attendants.
She had no need to ask for audience, for the King, his
affianced bride, and all the princes, were all much too
curious to know the reason of her coming, to think of
interrupting her. “Sire,” said she, “I hardly know if
the news I bring you will give you joy or sorrow; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">(278)</span>
marriage which you are about to celebrate convinces me
of your infidelity to the Queen.”</p>

<p>“Her memory is dear to me as ever,” said the King,
unable to prevent the falling of a tear or two; “but you
must know, kind frog, that kings are not always able to
do what they wish; for the last nine years, my subjects
have been urging me to marry; I owe them an heir to
the throne, and I have therefore chosen this young Princess,
who appears to me all that is charming.” “I advise
you not to marry her, for the Queen is not dead; I bring
you a letter from her, written with her own blood. A little
daughter, Moufette, has been born to you, more beautiful
than the heavens themselves.” The King took the rag,
on which the Queen had scrawled a few words; he kissed
it, he bathed it in his tears, he showed it to the whole
assembly, saying that he recognised his wife’s handwriting;
he asked the Frog a thousand questions, which she
answered with vivacity and intelligence.</p>

<p>The betrothed Princess, and the ambassadors who had
come to be present at the marriage, began to pull long
faces. One of the most important of the guests turned
to the King, and said, “Sire, can you think of breaking
so solemn an engagement, on the word of a toad like that?
This scum of the marshes has the insolence to come and
tell lies before the whole Court, for the pleasure of being
heard!” “Know, your Excellency,” replied the Frog,
“that I am no scum of the marshes, and since I am forced
to exhibit my powers: Come forth, fairies all!” And
thereupon all the frogs, rats, snails, lizards, with the frog
at their head, suddenly appeared; not, however, in the
usual form of these reptiles, but with tall, majestic figures,
pleasing countenances, and eyes more brilliant than stars;
each wore a jewelled crown on his head, and over his
shoulders a regal mantle of velvet, lined with ermine, with
a long train which was borne by dwarfs. At the same
time was heard the sound of trumpets, kettle-drums, hautboys,
and drums, filling the air with melodious and warlike
music, and all the fairies began to dance a ballet, their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">(283)</span>
every step so light, that the slightest spring lifted them to
the vaulted ceiling of the room. The King and his future
Queen, surprised as they were at this, were no less astonished,
when they saw all these fairy ballet dancers suddenly
change into flowers, jasmine, jonquils, violets, pinks, and
tube roses, which still continued to dance as if they had
legs and feet. It was like a living flower-bed, of which
every movement delighted both the eye and the sense of
smell. Another moment, and the flowers had disappeared;
in their place several fountains threw their waters into the
air and fell into an artificial lake at the foot of the castle
walls; this was covered with little painted and gilded boats,
so pretty and dainty that the Princess invited the ambassadors
to go for a trip on the water. They were all
pleased to do so, thinking it was all a merry pastime,
which would end happily in the marriage festivities. But
they had no sooner embarked, than the boats, water, and
fountains disappeared, and the frogs were frogs again. The
King asked what had become of the Princess; the Frog
replied, “Sire, no queen is yours, but your wife; were I
less attached to her than I am, I should not interfere;
but she is so deserving, and your daughter Moufette is so
charming that you ought not to delay a moment in going
to their deliverance.” “I assure you, Madam Frog,” said
the King, “that if I did not believe my wife to be dead,
there is nothing in the world I would not do to see her
again.” “After the wonders I have shown you,” she
replied, “it seems to me that you ought to be more
convinced of the truth of what I have told you. Leave
your kingdom in charge of trustworthy men, and start
without delay. Here is a ring which will furnish you with
the means of seeing the Queen, and of speaking with the
Fairy Lioness, although she is the most terrible creature in
the world.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp80" id="image280">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/image280.png"><img class="halfpage" src="images/image280_small.png" alt="" title="The audience"></a>
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/image281.png"><img class="halfpage" src="images/image281_small.png" alt="" title="The audience"></a>
</figure>

<p>The King departed, refusing to have anyone to accompany
him, after making handsome presents to the Frog:
“Do not be discouraged,” she said to him; “you will
meet with terrible difficulties, but I hope that you will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">(284)</span>
succeed according to your wishes.” Somewhat comforted
by her words, the King started in search of his dear
wife, with no other guide than his ring.</p>

<p>As Moufette grew older, her beauty became more
perfect, and all the monsters of the quicksilver lake fell
in love with her; and the dragons, with their hideous
and terrifying forms, came and lay at her feet. Although
Moufette had seen them ever since she was born, her
beautiful eyes could not accustom themselves to the sight
of these creatures, and she would run away and hide in
her mother’s arms. “Shall we remain here long?” she
asked her; “is there to be no end to our misery?”
The Queen spoke hopefully in order to cheer her child,
but in her heart she had no hope; the absence of the
Frog, her unbroken silence, the long time that had
elapsed since she had news of the King, all these things
filled her with sorrow and despair.</p>

<p>The Fairy Lioness had gradually made it a practice
to take them with her hunting. She was fond of good
things, and liked the game they killed for her, and
although all they got in return was the gift of the head
or the feet, it was something to be allowed to see again
the light of day. The fairy took the form of a lioness,
the Queen and her daughter seated themselves on her
back, and thus they went hunting through the forests.</p>

<p>The King happened to be resting in a forest one day,
whither his ring had guided him, and saw them pass like
an arrow shot from the bow; he was unseen of them,
and when he tried to follow them, they vanished completely
from his sight. Notwithstanding the constant
trouble she had been in, the Queen still preserved her
former beauty; she appeared to her husband more
charming than ever. He longed for her to return to him,
and feeling sure that the young Princess who was with
her was his dear little Moufette, he determined to face
a thousand deaths, rather than abandon his design of
rescuing her.</p>

<p>By the help of his ring, he found his way into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">(285)</span>
obscure region where the Queen had been so many years;
he was not a little surprised when he found himself descending
to the centre of the earth, but every fresh thing
he saw astonished him more and more. The Fairy
Lioness, who knew everything, was aware of the day and
the hour when he would arrive; she would have given
a great deal if the powers in league with her had ordained
otherwise; but she determined at least to oppose his
strength with the full might of her own.</p>

<p>She built a palace of crystal, which floated in the centre
of the lake of quicksilver, and rose and fell with its waves.
In it she imprisoned the Queen and her daughter, and
then harangued all the monsters who were in love with
Moufette. “You will lose this beautiful Princess,” she
said to them, “if you do not help me to protect her from
a knight who has come to carry her away.” The monsters
promised to leave nothing in their power undone; they
surrounded the palace of crystal; the lightest in weight
took their stations on the roof and walls; the others kept
guard at the doors, and the remainder in the lake.</p>

<p>The King, advised by his faithful ring, went first to the
Fairy’s Cave; she was awaiting him in her form of lioness.
As soon as he appeared she threw herself upon him; but
he handled his sword with a valour for which she was
not prepared, and as she was putting out one of her paws
to fell him to the earth, he cut it off at the joint just
where the elbow comes. She uttered a loud cry and fell
over; he went up to her, put his foot on her throat and
swore that he would kill her, and in spite of her ungovernable
fury and invulnerability, she felt a little afraid.
“What do you wish to do with me?” she asked. “What
do you want of me?” “I wish to punish you,” he replied
proudly, “for having carried away my wife, and you shall
give her up to me or I will strangle you on the spot.”
“Look towards the lake,” she said, “and see if I have
the power to do so.” The King turned in the direction
towards which she pointed, and saw the Queen and her
daughter in the palace of crystal, which was floating like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">(286)</span>
a vessel, without oars or rudder, on the lake of quicksilver.
He was ready to die with mingled joy and sorrow;
he called to them with all his might, and they heard him,
but how was he to reach them? While thinking over
the means by which he might accomplish this, the Fairy
Lioness disappeared. He ran round and round the lake,
but whenever the palace came close enough to him, on
one side or the other, for him to spring upon it, it
suddenly floated away again with terrible swiftness, and
so his hopes were continually disappointed. The Queen,
fearing he would at length grow weary, called to him not
to lose courage, that the Fairy Lioness wanted to tire him
out, but that true love knew how to face all difficulties.
She and Moufette then stretched out their hands towards
him with imploring gestures. Seeing this, the King was
filled with renewed courage, and raising his voice, he said
that he would rather pass the remainder of his life in this
melancholy region than go away without them. He needed
great patience, for no king on earth ever spent such a
wretched time before. He had only the ground, covered
with briars and thorns, for his bed; his food consisted
of wild fruits, more bitter than gall, and he was incessantly
engaged in defending himself from the monsters of the
lake.</p>

<p>Three years passed in this manner, and the King could
not flatter himself that he had gained the least advantage;
he was almost in despair, and over and over again was
tempted to throw himself in the lake, and he would
certainly have done so if he could have thought that by
such a deed he might alleviate the sufferings of the Queen
and the Princess. He was running one day as usual, first
to one side of the lake then to the other, when one of
the most hideous of the dragons called him, and said to
him: “If you will swear to me by your crown and sceptre,
by your royal mantle, by your wife and child, to give me,
whenever I shall ask for it, a certain delicate morsel to
eat, for which I have a taste, I will take you on my back,
and I promise you that none of the monsters of this lake,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">(287)</span>
who guard the palace, shall prevent us from carrying off
the Queen and Princess Moufette.”</p>

<p>“Ah! my beloved Dragon!” cried the King, “I swear
to you, and to all the family of dragons, that I will give
you your fill to eat of what you like, and will for ever
remain your humble servant.” “Do not make any
promises,” replied the Dragon, “if you have any thought
of not fulfilling them; for, in that case, misfortunes will
fall upon you that you will not forget as long as you live.”
The King renewed his protestations; he was dying of
impatience to get possession of his dear Queen. He
mounted on the Dragon’s back, as if it was the finest
horse in the world, but the other monsters now advanced
to bar his passage. They fought together, nothing was to
be heard but the sharp hissings of the serpents, nothing to
be seen but fire, and sulphur, and saltpetre, falling in every
direction. At last the King reached the palace, but here
his efforts had to be renewed, for the entrances were
defended by bats, owls, and ravens; however, the Dragon,
with his claws, his teeth and tail, cut to pieces even the
boldest of these. The Queen, on her side, who was
looking on at this fierce encounter, kicked away pieces of
the wall, and armed herself with these to help her dear
husband. They were at last victorious; they ran into one
another’s arms, and the work of disenchantment was
completed by a thunderbolt, which fell into the lake and
dried it up.</p>

<p>The friendly Dragon had disappeared with all the other
monsters, and the King, by what means he could not
guess, found himself again in his own capital, seated, with
his Queen and Moufette, in a magnificent dining-hall, with
a table spread with exquisite meats in front of them.
Such joy and astonishment as theirs were unknown before.
All their subjects ran in to see the Queen and the young
Princess, who, to add to the wonder of it all, was so
superbly dressed, that the eye could hardly bear to look
upon her dazzling jewels.</p>

<p>It is easy to imagine the festivities that now went on at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">(288)</span>
the castle; masquerades, running at the ring, and tournaments
attracted the greatest princes in the world; but
even more were they attracted by the bright eyes of
Moufette. Among those who were the handsomest and most
accomplished in feats of arms, Prince Moufy everywhere
was the most conspicuous. He was universally admired
and applauded, and Moufette, who hitherto had been only
in the company of dragons and serpents, did not withhold
her share of praise. No day passed but Prince
Moufy showed her some fresh attention, in the hope of
pleasing her, for he loved her deeply; and having offered
himself as a suitor, he made known to the King and
Queen, that his principality was of a beauty and extent
that deserved their special attention.</p>

<p>The King replied that Moufette was at liberty to choose
a husband, and that he only wished to please her and
make her happy. The Prince was delighted with this
answer, and having already become aware that he was not
indifferent to the Princess, offered her his hand. She
assured him that if he was not her husband, no other man
should be, and Moufy, overcome with joy, threw himself
at her feet, and in affectionate terms begged her to
remember the promise she had given him. The Prince
and Princess were betrothed, and Prince Moufy then
returned to his principality to make preparations for the
marriage. Moufette shed many tears at his departure, for
she was troubled with the presentiment of evil which she
could not explain. The Queen, seeing that the Prince
was also overcome with sorrow, gave him the portrait of
her daughter, and begged him rather to lessen the magnificence
of the preparations than to delay his return. The
Prince, only too ready to obey such a command, promised
to comply with what would be for his own happiness.</p>

<p>The Princess occupied herself during his absence with
her music, for she had, in a few months, learnt to play well.
One day, when she was in the Queen’s room, the King
rushed in, his face bathed in tears, and taking his daughter
in his arms: “Alas, my child,” he cried. “Alas!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">(289)</span>
wretched father, unhappy King!” He could say no
more, for his voice was stifled with sobs. The Queen and
Princess, in great alarm, asked him what was the matter,
and at last he was able to tell them that a giant of an
enormous height, who gave himself out to be an ambassador
from the Dragon of the lake, had just arrived;
that in accordance with the promise, made by the King
in return for the help he had received in fighting the
monsters, the Dragon demanded him to give up the
Princess, as he wished to make her into a pie for his
dinner; the King added that he had bound himself by
solemn oaths to give him what he asked, and in those
days no one ever broke his word.</p>

<p>When the Queen heard this dreadful news, she uttered
piercing cries, and clasped her child to her breast. “My
life shall be taken,” she said, “before my daughter shall
be delivered up to that monster; let him rather take our
kingdom and all that we possess. Unnatural father! can
you possibly consent to such a cruel thing? What! my
child made into a pie! The thought of it is intolerable!
Send me this terrible ambassador, maybe the sight of my
anguish may touch his heart.”</p>

<p>The King made no reply, but went in search of the
giant and brought him to the Queen, who threw herself at
his feet. She and her daughter implored him to have
mercy upon them, and to persuade the Dragon to take
everything they possessed, and to spare Moufette’s life;
but the giant replied that the matter did not rest with him,
and that the Dragon was so obstinate and so fond of good
things, that all the powers combined would not prevent
him eating whatever he had taken into his head he would
like for a meal. He further advised them, as a friend, to
consent with a good grace, as otherwise greater evils
might arise. At these words the Queen fainted, and the
Princess, had she not been obliged to go to her mother’s
assistance, would have done the same.</p>

<p>No sooner was the sad news spread through the palace,
than the whole town knew it. Nothing was heard but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">(290)</span>
weeping and wailing, for Moufette was greatly beloved.
The King could not make up his mind to give her to the
giant, and the giant, who had already waited some days,
began to grow impatient, and to utter terrible threats.
The King and Queen, however, said to each other,
“What worse thing could happen to us? If the Dragon
of the lake were to come and devour us all we could not
be more distressed; if Moufette is put into a pie, we are
lost.”</p>

<p>The giant now told them that he had received a message
from his master, and that if the Princess would agree to
marry a nephew of his, the Dragon would let her live;
that the nephew was young and handsome; that, moreover,
he was a Prince, and that she would be able to
live with him very happily. This proposal somewhat
lessened their grief; the Queen spoke to the Princess,
but found her still more averse to this marriage than to
the thought of death. “I cannot save my life by being
unfaithful,” said Moufette. “You promised me to Prince
Moufy, and I will marry no one else; let me die; my
death will ensure the peace of your lives.” The King
then came and endeavoured with all the tenderest of
expressions to persuade her; but nothing moved her, and
finally it was decided that she should be conducted to the
summit of a mountain, and there await the Dragon.</p>

<p>Everything was prepared for this great sacrifice; nothing
so mournful had before been seen; nothing to be met
anywhere but black garments, and pale and horrified faces.
Four hundred maidens of the highest rank, dressed in
long white robes, and crowned with cypress, accompanied
the Princess, who was carried in an open litter of black
velvet, that all might look on this masterpiece of beauty.
Her hair, tied with crape, hung over her shoulders, and
she wore a crown of jasmine, mingled with a few marigolds.
The grief of the King and Queen, who followed,
overcome by their deep sorrow, appeared the only thing
that moved her. The giant, armed from head to foot,
marched beside the litter, and looked with hungry eye<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">(291)</span>
at the Princess, as if anticipating his share of her when
she came to be eaten; the air resounded with sighs and
sobs, and the road was flooded with the tears of the
onlookers.</p>

<p>“Ah! Frog, Frog,” cried the Queen, “you have indeed
forsaken me! Alas! why did you give me help in that
unhappy region, and now withhold it from me! Would
that I had then died, I should not now be lamenting the
loss of all my hopes, I should not now have the anguish
of seeing my dear Moufette on the point of being
devoured!” The procession meanwhile was slowly advancing,
and at last reached the summit of the fatal
mountain. Here the cries and lamentations were redoubled,
nothing more piteous had before been heard.
The giant ordered everyone to say farewell and to retire,
and they all obeyed him, for in those days, people were
very simple and submissive, and never sought for a remedy
in their misfortunes.</p>

<p>The King and Queen, and all the Court, now ascended
another mountain, whence they could see all that happened
to the Princess: and they had not to wait long, before
they saw a Dragon, half a league long, coming through
the air. His body was so heavy that, notwithstanding
his six large wings, he was hardly able to fly; he was
covered with immense blue scales, and poisonous tongues
of flame; his tail was twisted into as many as fifty and a
half coils; each of his claws was the size of a <span id="cor291">windmill</span>,
and three rows of teeth, as long as those of an elephant,
could be seen inside his wide-open jaw. As the Dragon
slowly made his way towards the mountain, the good,
faithful Frog, mounted on the back of a hawk, flew rapidly
to Prince Moufy. She wore her cap of roses, and although
he was locked into his private room, she entered without
a key, and said, “What are you doing here, unhappy lover?
You sit dreaming of Moufette’s beauty, and at this very
moment she is exposed to the most frightful danger; here
is a rose-leaf, by blowing upon it, I can change it into a
superb horse, as you will see.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">(292)</span></p>

<p>There immediately appeared a horse, green in colour,
and with twelve hoofs and three heads, of which one
emitted fire, another bomb-shells, and the third cannon-balls.
She gave the Prince a sword, eight yards long,
and lighter than a feather. She clothed him with a
single diamond, which he put on like a coat, and which,
although as hard as a rock, was so pliable that he could
move in it at his ease. “Go,” she said, “run, fly to the
rescue of her whom you love; the green horse I have
given you, will take you to her, and when you have
delivered her, let her know the share I have had in the
matter.”</p>

<p>“Generous fairy,” cried the Prince, “I cannot at this
moment show you all my gratitude; but henceforth, I am
your faithful servitor.”</p>

<p>He mounted the horse with the three heads, which
instantly galloped off on its twelve hoofs, and went at
a greater rate than three of the best ordinary horses, so
that in a very little time the Prince reached the mountain,
when he found his dear Princess all alone, and saw the
Dragon slowly drawing near. The green horse immediately
began to send forth fire, bomb-shells, and cannon-balls,
which not a little astonished the monster; he
received twenty balls in his throat, and his scales were
somewhat damaged, and the bomb-shells put out one of
his eyes. He grew furious, and made as if to throw
himself on the Prince; but Moufy’s long sword was so
finely-tempered, that he could use it as he liked, thrusting
it in at times up to the hilt, and at others using it
like a whip; still he would have suffered from the
Dragon’s claws, had it not been for his diamond coat,
which was impenetrable.</p>

<p>Moufette had recognised her lover a long way off, for
the diamond that covered him was transparent and bright,
and she was seized with mortal terror at the danger he
was in. The King and Queen, however, were filled with
renewed hope, for it was such an unexpected thing to see
a horse with three heads and twelve hoofs, sending forth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">(295)</span>
fire and flame, and a Prince in a diamond suit and armed
with a formidable sword, arrive at such an opportune
moment, and fight with so much valour. The King put
his hat on the top of his stick, and the Queen tied her
handkerchief to the end of another, as signals of encouragement
to the Prince; and all their Court followed
suit. As a fact, this was not necessary, for his own heart
and the peril in which he saw Moufette, were sufficient to
animate his courage. And what efforts did he not make!
the ground was covered with stings, claws, horns, wings,
and scales of the Dragon; the earth was coloured blue
and green with the mingled blood of the Dragon and the
horse. Five times the Prince fell to the ground, but each
time he rose again and leisurely mounted his horse, and
then there were cannonades, and rushing of flames, and
explosions, such as were never heard or seen before. The
Dragon’s strength at last gave way, and he fell; the Prince
gave him a final blow, and nobody could believe their eyes,
when from this last great wound, there stepped forth a
handsome and charming prince, in a coat of blue and gold
velvet, embroidered with pearls, while on his head he wore
a little Grecian helmet, shaded with white feathers. He
rushed, his arms outspread, towards Prince Moufy, and
embraced him. “What do I not owe you, valiant
liberator?” he cried. “You have delivered me from a
worse prison than ever before enclosed a king; I have
languished there since, sixteen years ago, the Fairy Lioness
condemned me to it; and, such was her power, that she
would have forced me, against my will, to devour that
adorable Princess; lead me to her feet, that I may explain
to her my misfortune.”</p>

</div>

<p>Prince Moufy, surprised and delighted at this extraordinary
termination to his adventure, showered civilities
on the newly-found Prince. They hastened to rejoin
Moufette, who thanked Heaven a thousand times for her
unhoped-for happiness. The King, the Queen, and all
the Court, were already with her; everybody spoke at
once, nobody listened to anybody else, and they all shed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">(296)</span>
nearly as many tears of joy as they had before of grief.
Finally, that nothing might be wanting to complete
their rejoicing, the good Frog appeared, flying through
the air on her hawk, which had little bells of gold
on its feet. When the tinkle, tinkle, of these was
heard, everyone looked up, and saw the cap of roses
shining like the sun, and the Frog as beautiful as the
dawn.</p>

<p>The Queen ran towards her, and took her by one of
her little paws, and in the same moment, the wise Frog
became a great Queen, with a charming countenance. “I
come,” she cried, “to crown the faithful Moufette, who
preferred to risk her life, rather than be untrue to Prince
Moufy.” She thereupon took two myrtle wreaths, and
placed them on the heads of the lovers, and giving three
taps with her wand, all the
Dragon’s bones formed themselves
into a triumphal arch,
in commemoration of the
great event which had just
taken place.</p>

<p>They all wended their
way back to the town, singing
wedding songs, as gaily
as they had before mournfully
bewailed the sacrifice of
the Princess. The marriage
took place the following day,
and the joy with which it
was celebrated may be
imagined.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>When the Fay had finished
all were agreed that her story
was not a word too long, and all thanked her as she
flew back with daintily fluttering little wings back to her
place. All began wondering what the next story would
be like. They did not have to wonder long for Titania,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">(297)</span>
turning to King Oberon, said, “I have chosen several
stories, you choose now.”</p>

<p>“I think,” said Oberon, “that the Scandinavian Dwarf
who told us our first tale about Thor and the wicked
Loki could perhaps tell us another.”</p>

<p>As soon as he spoke the Scandinavian Dwarf came
forward, well pleased of course at being so honoured, and
said, “I will tell your Majesty, then, a further tale of how
it was that Thor managed to get the Heroes out of a
nasty fix into which they had got themselves with a dwarf
who lived in a dark underground place, who had made
them promise that he should marry their most beautiful
Freya. It is the story,” he began, “of the ambition and
undoing of</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Allwise the Dwarf once by his cunning wiles entrapped
the Heroes into a promise that they would give him the
beautiful Freya for his wife, and he set out from his cavern
home for Asgard that he might claim fulfilment of the
promise. Before leaving he gave orders to his servant
dwarfs that they should deck the place against his return
with the bride.</p>

<p>Now the Heroes of Asgard finding that they had been
tricked into making a promise which they did not intend
marvelled how they might spare themselves the fulfilling
of it. Thor at length suggested that as Allwise would
visit Asgard by night, and as he could not bear the sunlight,
they should keep him engaged in talk until the sun
rose, and what is more he offered to do this himself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">(299)</span>
and so when the dwarf reached the city of the Heroes
it was Thor whom he first encountered, and who hailed
him thus: “What fellow art thou? Why art thou pale
as if thou hadst come from among the dead? Surely
thou art but a sorry bridegroom.”</p>

<p>Then answered the dwarf: “Allwise my name is; I
dwell in a cavern beneath the earth, and I am come to
fetch my bride for the Heroes will not break their plighted
word.”</p>

<p>“I will break it,” said Thor firmly, “for Freya is my
ward, and I was not of those who made the promise to
you. It is needful that I should hallow the weddings
of the Heroes.”</p>

<p>“Who is this fellow,” said Allwise the dwarf scornfully,
“who claims to control the fair-beaming maid?”</p>

<p>“Thor is my name,” answered the Hero wrathfully,
“I am Longbeard’s son. I have travelled far. Without
my will thou shalt never have the maid, or make this
match.”</p>

<p>“I would rather have thy good will; I would sooner
win than want the snow-white maid.”</p>

<p>“The maiden’s love shall not be denied to thee, thou
wise guest,” said Thor with guile, “if thou canst tell me
all that I want to know.”</p>

<p>“That can I do,” answered the dwarf confidently.</p>

<p>“Tell me, then, Allwise, for methinks thou, Dwarf,
knowest the whole history of mankind, how is the Earth,
which lies about the sons of men, called by all different
beings that are?”</p>

<p class="noindent">There was once a widow who had two daughters. The
elder was so like her mother in temper and face, that to
have seen the one was to have seen the other. They
were both so disagreeable and proud, that it was impossible
to live with them. The younger, who was the
exact portrait of her father in her kindly and polite ways
was also as beautiful a girl as one could see. As we are
naturally fond of those who resemble us, the mother doted
on her elder daughter, while for the younger she had a
most violent aversion, and made her take her meals in the
kitchen and work hard all day. Among other things that
she was obliged to do, this poor child was forced to go
twice a day to fetch water from a place a mile or more
from the house, and carry back a large jug filled to the
brim. As she was standing one day by this spring, a poor
woman came up to her, and asked the girl to give her
some water to drink.</p>

<p>“Certainly, my good woman,” she replied, and the
beautiful girl at once stooped and rinsed out the jug, and
then, filling it with water from the clearest part of the
spring, she held it up to the woman, continuing to support
the jug, that she might drink with greater comfort.
Having drunk, the woman said to her, “You are so
beautiful, so good and kind, that I cannot refrain from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">(306)</span>
conferring a gift upon you,” for she was really a fairy, who
had taken the form of a poor village woman, in order to
see how far the girl’s kindheartedness would go. “This
gift I make you,” continued the fairy, “that with every
word you speak, either a flower or a precious stone will
fall from your mouth.”</p>

<p>The girl had no sooner reached home than her mother
began scolding her for being back so late. “I am sorry,
mother,” said she, “to have been out so long,” and as she
spoke, there fell from her mouth two roses, two pearls, and
two large diamonds. The mother gazed at her in astonishment.
“What do I see!” she exclaimed, “pearls and
diamonds seem to be dropping from her mouth! How
is this, my daughter?”—it was the first time she had
called her <em>daughter</em>. The poor child related in all
simplicity what had happened, letting fall quantities of
diamonds in the course of her narrative. “I must certainly
send my other daughter there,” said the mother.
“Look, Fanchon, see what falls from your sister’s mouth
when she speaks! Would you not be glad to receive a
similar gift? All you have to do, is to go and fetch water
from the spring, and if an old woman asks you for some
to drink, to give it her nicely and politely.” “I should
like to see myself going to the spring,” answered the rude,
cross girl.</p>

<p>“I insist on your going,” rejoined the mother, “and
that at once.”</p>

<p>The elder girl went off, still grumbling; with her she took
the handsomest silver bottle she could find in the house.</p>

<p>She had no sooner arrived at the spring, than she saw a
lady magnificently dressed walking towards her from the
wood, who approached and asked for some water to drink.
It was the same fairy who had appeared to the sister, but
she had now put on the airs and apparel of a princess, as
she wished to see how far this girl’s rudeness would go.
“Do you think I came here just to draw water for you?”
answered the arrogant and unmannerly girl; “I have, of
course, brought this silver bottle on purpose for madam to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">(309)</span>
drink from! Well, all I have to say is—drink from it if
you like.”</p>

</div>

<p>“You are scarcely polite,” said the fairy, without losing
her temper; “however, as you are so disobliging, I confer
this gift upon you, that with every word you speak, a
snake or a toad shall fall from your mouth.”</p>

<p>Directly her mother caught sight of her, she called out,
“Well, my daughter!” “Well, my mother!” replied the
ill-tempered girl, throwing out as she spoke two vipers and
two toads. “Alack!” cried the mother, “what do I see?
This is her sister’s doing, but I will pay her out for it,”
and, so saying, she ran towards the younger girl with intent
to beat her. The unhappy girl fled from the house,
and went and hid herself in a neighbouring forest. The
King’s son, who was returning from hunting, met her, and
seeing how beautiful she was, asked her what she was
doing there all alone, and why she was crying. “Alas!
sir, my mother has driven me from home.” The King’s
son, seeing five or six pearls and as many diamonds, falling
from her mouth as she spoke, asked her to explain how
this was, and she told him all her tale. The King’s son
fell in love with her, and thinking that such a gift as she
possessed was worth more than any ordinary dower brought
by another, he carried her off to his father’s palace, and
there married her.</p>

<p>As for her sister, she made
herself so hated, that her own
mother drove her from the
house. The miserable girl, having
gone about in
vain trying to find
someone who would
take her in, crept
away into the corner of a wood, and there died.</p>

<p class="noindent">At an early age St Dolly showed the sweetness of her
nature by her tender love for her widowed father, a baker,
dwelling at Pie Corner, with a large family of little children.
It chanced that with bad harvests bread became so dear
that, of course, bakers were ruined by high prices. The
miller fell upon Dolly’s father, and swept the shop with his
golden thumb. Not a bed was left for the baker or his
little ones. St Dolly slept upon a flour sack, having prayed
that good angels would help her to help her father. Now
sleeping, she dreamt that the oven was lighted, and she felt
falling in a shower about her, raisins, currants, almonds,
lemon peel, flour, with heavy drops of brandy. Then in
her dreams she saw the
fairies gather up the
things that fell, and knead
them into a cake. They
put the cake into the
oven, and dancing round
and round, the fairies
vanished, crying, “Draw
the cake, Dolly—Dolly,
draw the cake.” And
Dolly awoke and drew
the cake, and, behold, it
was the first Twelfth
Cake, sugared at the top,
and bearing the images of Faith, Hope and Charity. Now
this cake, shown in the window, came to the king’s ear;
and the king bought the cake, and married Dolly to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">(314)</span>
grand falconer, to whom she proved a faithful and loving
wife, bearing him a baker’s dozen of lovely children.</p>

<p>There was a general laugh at Pink’s story, it was so <em>very</em>
short, and Pink felt quite proud of herself in having got
through her tale telling about twice as quickly as Quick.</p>

<p>“Only two more stories,” said Oberon, “and then all
must fly back to their proper work as fairies. There are
so many of us here that would like to take a turn on the
tale-teller’s stool that it is now not easy to choose, so we
will have our next story from the first fairy who can get

rush began, “you must all go to your places and start fair
when I say ‘three.’” There was a pause while all settled
back in their places, and then Oberon said slowly, “One—Two—Three.”</p>

<p>As soon as the last word was heard there was such a
scramble and rush from all parts of the ring, some running,
some flying, but the nimblest of all was a Kobold, who
seated himself firmly on the stool and would not let himself
be pushed off. As soon as it was seen that the stool
was occupied all the fairies who had tried to get there
went laughing merrily back to their places, and the Kobold
triumphantly began the story of</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="the_little_glass_shoe">The Little Glass Shoe</h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent">A peasant, named John Wilde, found
one time a glass shoe on one of the
hills where the little people used to
dance. He clapped it instantly into
his pocket and ran away with it, keeping
his hand as close on his pocket as if he had a dove in it,
for he knew that he had found a treasure which the underground
people must redeem at any price.</p>

<p>Others say that John Wilde lay in ambush one night for
the underground people, and gained an opportunity of pulling
off one of their shoes, by stretching himself there with a
brandy-bottle beside him, and acting like one that was dead
drunk; for he was a very cunning man, not over scrupulous
in his morals, and had taken in many a one by his craftiness,
and, on this account, his name was in no good repute
among his neighbours, who, to say the truth, were willing
to have as little to do with him as possible. Many hold,
too, that he was acquainted with forbidden arts, and used
to carry on an intercourse with the fiends and old women
that raised storms, and such like.</p>

<p>However, be this as it may, when John had gotten the
shoe, he lost no time in letting the folk that dwell under
the ground know that he had it. So at midnight he went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">(316)</span>
to the Nine-hills, and cried with all his might, “John Wilde
of Rodenkirchen has got a beautiful glass shoe. Who will
buy it, who will buy it?” For he knew that the little one
who had lost the shoe must go barefoot till he got it again,
and that is no trifle, for the little people have generally to
walk upon very hard and stony ground.</p>

<p>John’s advertisement was speedily attended to. The
little fellow who had lost the shoe made no delay in setting
about redeeming it. The first free day he got, that he
might come out into the daylight, he came as a respectable
merchant, and knocked at John Wilde’s door, and asked
if John had not a glass shoe to sell. “For,” says he,
“they are an article now in great demand, and are sought
for in every market.” John replied that it was true he had
a very little little, nice, pretty little glass shoe, but it was so
small that even a dwarf’s foot would be squeezed in it, and
that God Almighty must make people on purpose for it
before it could be of any use, but that, for all that, it was
an extraordinary shoe and a valuable shoe, and a dear shoe,
and it was not every merchant that could afford to pay
for it.</p>

<p>The merchant asked to see it, and when he had examined
it, “Glass shoes” said he, “are not by any means such rare
articles, my good friend, as you think here in Rodenkirchen,
because you do not happen to go much into the world.
However,” said he, after hemming a little, “I will give you
a good price for it, because I happen to have the very fellow
of it.” And he bid the countryman a thousand dollars
for it.</p>

<p>“A thousand dollars are money, my father used to say
when he drove fat oxen to market,” replied John Wilde, in
a mocking tone; “but it will not leave my hands for that
shabby price, and, for my own part, it may ornament the
foot of my daughter’s doll. Harkye, friend; I have heard
a sort of little song sung about the glass shoe, and it is not
for a parcel of dirt that it will go out of my hands. Tell
me now, my good fellow, should you happen to know the
knack of it, that in every furrow I make when I am ploughing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">(317)</span>
I should find a ducat. If not, the shoe is still mine,
and you may inquire for glass shoes at those other
markets.”</p>

<p>The merchant made still a great many attempts, and
twisted and turned in every direction to get the shoe, but
when he found the farmer inflexible he agreed to what
John desired, and swore to the performance of it.</p>

<p>Cunning John believed in him, and gave him up the
glass shoe, for he knew right well with whom he had to
do. So the business being ended, away went the merchant
with his glass shoe.</p>

<p>Without a moment’s delay, John repaired to his stable,
got ready his horses and his plough, and drove out to the
field. He selected a piece of ground where he would
have the shortest turns possible, and began to plough.
Hardly had the plough turned up the first sod, when up
sprang a ducat out of the ground, and it was the same
with every fresh furrow he made. There was now no end
of his ploughing, and John Wilde soon bought eight new
horses, and put them into the stable to the eight he
already had—and their mangers were never without
plenty of oats in them—that he might be able every two
hours to yoke two fresh horses, and so be enabled to
drive them the faster.</p>

<p>John was now insatiable in ploughing, every morning he
was out before sunrise, and many a time he ploughed on
till after midnight. Summer and winter it was plough,
plough with him evermore, except when the ground was
frozen as hard as a stone. But he always ploughed by
himself, and never suffered any one to go out with him, or
to come to him when he was at work, for John understood
too well the nature of his crop to let people see what it
was he ploughed so constantly for.</p>

<p>But it fared far worse with himself than with his horses,
who ate good oats and were regularly changed and relieved,
while he grew pale and meagre by reason of his continual
working and toiling. His wife and children had no
longer any comfort of him, he never went to the ale-house<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">(318)</span>
or the club, he withdrew himself from every one, and
scarcely ever spoke a single word, but went about silent
and wrapped up in his own thoughts. All the day long
he toiled for his ducats, and at night he had to count them
and to plan and meditate how he might find out a still
swifter kind of plough.</p>

<p>His wife and the neighbours lamented over his strange
conduct, his dulness and melancholy, and began to think
that he was grown foolish. Everybody pitied his wife and
children, for they imagined that the numerous horses that
he kept in his stable, and the preposterous mode of
agriculture that he pursued, with his unnecessary and
superfluous ploughing, must soon leave him without house
or land.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp20" id="image318">
  <a rel="nofollow" href="images/image318.png"><img class="w100" src="images/image318_small.png" alt="" title="Tailpiece"></a>
</figure>

<p>But their anticipations were not fulfilled. True it is,
the poor man never enjoyed a happy or contented hour
since he began to plough the ducats up out of the ground.
The old saying held good in his case, that he who
gives himself up to the pursuit of gold is half way in the
claws of the evil one. Flesh and blood cannot bear
perpetual labour, and John Wilde did not long hold out
against this running through the furrows day and night.
He got through the first spring, but
one day, in the second, he dropped
down at the tail of the plough like
an exhausted November fly. Out
of the pure thirst
after gold he was
wasted away and
dried up to nothing
whereas he had been
a very strong and hearty man
the day the shoe of the little
underground man fell into his
hands.</p>

<p>His wife, however, found after him a considerable
treasure, two great nailed up chests full of good new
ducats, and his sons purchased large estates for themselves,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">(321)</span>
and became lords and noblemen. But what good did all
that do poor John Wilde.</p>

<p>“And now,” said the King, “we come to our last story,
and I think it shall be told us by the fairy who comes from
the furthest North.”</p>

<p>Several dwarfs and Elves started up at this word, but the
King signalled them back to their places; “No,” he said,
“none of you is the one from farthest North.” Then
slowly up the middle of the circle came a quaint little
figure all in white with long white hair and beard—looking,
only of course the idea is ridiculous, like an <em>old</em>
fairy. He had come from the land of perpetual winter,
where everything is white as the everlasting snow, but
though he looked old he was lively and youthful as the
most frolicsome of the flower fairies there. He skipped
briskly on to the stool, then passing his hand down his
long white beard—strange guest where all was so
brilliantly coloured—he began a story which he named</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Once on a time there was a poor husbandman who had so
many children that he hadn’t much of either food or clothing
to give them. Pretty children they all were, but the
prettiest was the youngest daughter, who was so lovely
there was no end to her loveliness.</p>

<p>So one day, ’twas on a Thursday evening late at the fall
of the year, the weather was so wild and rough outside,
and it was so cruelly dark, and rain fell and wind blew,
till the walls of the cottage shook again. There they all
sat round the fire busy with this thing and that. But
just then, all at once, something gave three taps on the
window-pane. Then the father went out to see what was
the matter; and, when he got out of doors, what should
he see but a great big White Bear.</p>

<p>“Good evening to you!” said the White Bear.</p>

<p>“The same to you,” said the man.</p>

<p>“Will you give me your youngest daughter? If you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">(323)</span>
will, I’ll make you as rich as you are now poor,” said the
Bear.</p>

<p>Well, the man would not be at all sorry to be so rich, but
still he thought he must have a bit of a talk with his
daughter first, so he went in and told them how there
was a great White Bear waiting outside, who had given his
word to make them so rich if he could only have the
youngest daughter.</p>

<p>The lassie said “No!” outright. Nothing could get
her to say anything else; so the man went out and
settled it with the White Bear, that he should come again
the next Thursday evening and get an answer. Meantime
he talked his daughter over, and kept on telling her of all
the riches they would get, and how well off she would be
herself, so at last she thought better of it, and washed and
mended her rags, made herself as smart as she could, and
was ready to start. I can’t say her packing gave her
much trouble.</p>

<p>Next Thursday evening came the White Bear to fetch
her, and she got upon his back with her bundle, and off
they went. So when they had gone a bit of the way, the
White Bear said:—</p>

<p>“Are you afraid?”</p>

<p>“No! she wasn’t.”</p>

<p>“Well! mind and hold tight by my shaggy coat, and
then there’s nothing to fear,” said the Bear.</p>

<p>So she rode a long, long way, till they came to a great
steep hill. There on the face of it the White Bear gave
a knock, and a door opened, and they came into a castle,
where there were many rooms all lit up, rooms gleaming
with silver and gold, and there too was a table ready laid,
and it was all as grand as grand could be. Then the White
Bear gave her a silver bell, saying that if she rang it when
she wanted anything she would get it at once.</p>

<p>Well, after she had eaten and drunk, and evening wore
on, she got sleepy after her journey, and thought she
would like to go to bed, so she rang the bell, and she
had scarce taken hold of it before she came into a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">(324)</span>
chamber, where there was a bed made, as fair and white as
any one would wish to sleep in, with silken pillows and
curtains and gold fringe. All that was in the room was
gold or silver, but when she had gone to bed, and put out
the light, a man came and laid himself alongside her.
That was the White Bear, who threw off his beast-shape at
night, but she never saw him, for he always came after
she had put out the light, and before the day dawned he
was up and off again. So things went on happily for a
while, but at last she began to get silent and sorrowful, for
there she went about all day alone, and she longed to go
home to see her father and mother, and brothers and
sisters. So one day, when the White Bear asked what it
was that she lacked, she said it was so dull and lonely
there, and how she longed to go home to see her father
and mother, and brothers and sisters, and that was why
she was so sad and sorrowful, because she couldn’t get to
them.</p>

<p>“Well, well!” said the Bear, “perhaps there’s a cure
for all this, but you must promise me one thing, not to
talk alone with your mother but only when the rest are
by to hear, for she’ll take you by the hand and try to
lead you into a room alone to talk, but you must mind
and not do that, else you’ll bring bad luck on both of us.”</p>

<p>So one Sunday the White Bear came and said now
they could set off to see her father and mother. Well,
off they started, she sitting on his back, and they went
far and long. At last they came to a grand house, and
there her brothers and sisters were running about out of
doors at play, and everything was so pretty, ’twas a joy
to see.</p>

<p>“This is where your father and mother live now,” said
the White Bear, “but don’t forget what I told you, else
you’ll make us both unlucky.”</p>

<p>“No! bless her, she’d not forget”; and when she had
reached the house, the White Bear turned right about
and left her.</p>

<p>Then when she went in to see her father and mother,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">(325)</span>
there was such joy, there was no end to it. None of
them thought they could thank her enough for all she
had done for them. Now they had everything they
wished, as good as good could be, and they all wanted
to know how she got on where she lived.</p>

<p>Well, she said, it was very good to live where she did;
she had all she wished. What she said beside I don’t
know, but I don’t think any of them had the right end
of the stick, or that they got much out of her. But so
in the afternoon, after they had done dinner, all happened
as the White Bear had said. Her mother wanted to talk
with her alone in her bedroom, but she minded what the
White Bear had said, and wouldn’t go upstairs.</p>

<p>“Oh! what we have to talk about will keep,” she said,
and put her mother off. But somehow or other, her
mother got round her at last, and she had to tell her
the whole story. So she said, how every night, when she
had gone to bed, a man came and lay down beside her
as soon as she had put out the light, how she never saw
him, because he was always up and away before the
morning dawned, and how she went about woeful and
sorrowing, for she thought she should so much like to
see him, and how all day long she walked about there
alone, and how dull, and dreary, and lonesome it was.</p>

<p>“My!” said her mother; “it may well be a Troll you
slept with! But now I’ll teach you a lesson how to set
eyes on him. I’ll give you a bit of candle, which you
can carry home in your bosom; just light that while he
is asleep, but take care not to drop the tallow on him.”</p>

<p>Yes! she took the candle, and hid it in her bosom,
and as night drew on, the White Bear came and fetched
her away.</p>

<p>But when they had gone a bit of the way, the White
Bear asked if all hadn’t happened as he had said.</p>

<p>“Well, she couldn’t say it hadn’t.”</p>

<p>“Now, mind,” said he, “if you have listened to your
mother’s advice, you have brought bad luck on us both, and
then all that has passed between us will be as nothing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">(326)</span></p>

<p>“No,” she said, “she hadn’t listened to her mother’s
advice.”</p>

<p>So when she had reached home, and had gone to
bed, it was the old story over again. There came a man
and lay down beside her; but at dead of night, when she
heard he slept, she got up and struck a light, lit the
candle, and let the light shine on him, and so she saw
that he was the loveliest Prince one ever set eyes on,
and she fell so deep in love with him, on the spot, that
she thought she couldn’t live if she didn’t give him a
kiss there and then. And so she did, but as she kissed
him she dropped three hot drops of tallow on his shirt,
and he woke up.</p>

<p>“What have you done?” he cried; “now you have
made us both unlucky, for had you held out only this
one year, I had been freed. For I have a stepmother who
has bewitched me, so that I am a White Bear by day
and a man by night. But now all ties are snapped between
us, now I must set off from you to her. She lives in a
castle which stands <span class="allsmcap">EAST O’ THE SUN AND WEST O’ THE
MOON</span>, and there, too, is a Princess, with a nose three ells
long, and she’s the wife I must have now.”</p>

<p>She wept and took it ill, but there was no help for it;
go he must.</p>

<p>Then she asked if she mightn’t go with him.</p>

<p>No, she mightn’t.</p>

<p>“Tell me the way then,” she said, “and I’ll search you
out; that surely I may get leave to do.”</p>

<p>“Yes, she might do that,” he said, “but there was no
way to that place. It lay <span class="allsmcap">EAST O’ THE SUN AND WEST O’
THE MOON</span>, and thither she’d never find her way.”</p>

<p>So next morning when she woke up both Prince and
castle were gone, and then she lay on a little green patch,
in the midst of the gloomy thick wood, and by her side
lay the same bundle of rags she had brought with her
from her old home.</p>

<p>So when she had rubbed the sleep out of her eyes,
and wept till she was tired, she set out on her way, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">(327)</span>
walked many, many days, till she came to a lofty rock.
Under it sat an old hag, and played with a golden apple
which she tossed about. Her the lassie asked if she knew
the way to the prince, who lived with his stepmother in
the Castle, that lay <span class="allsmcap">EAST O’ THE SUN AND WEST O’ THE
MOON</span>, and who was to marry the Princess with a nose
three ells long.</p>

<p>“How did you come to know about him?” asked the
old hag; “but maybe you are the lassie who ought to have
had him?”</p>

<p>Yes, she was.</p>

<p>“So, so, it’s you, is it?” said the old hag. “Well,
all I know about him is, that he lives in the castle that
lies <span class="allsmcap">EAST O’ THE SUN AND WEST O’ THE MOON</span>, and thither
you’ll come, late or never; but still you may have the
loan of my horse, and on him you can ride to my next
neighbour. Maybe she’ll be able to tell you; and when
you get there, just give the horse a switch under the left
ear, and beg him to be off home; and, stay, this gold
apple you may take with you.”</p>

<p>So she got upon the horse, and rode a long long time,
till she came to another rock, under which sat another
old hag, with a gold carding-comb. Her the lassie asked
if she knew the way to the castle that lay <span class="allsmcap">EAST O’ THE SUN
AND WEST O’ THE MOON</span>, and she answered, like the first old
hag, that she knew nothing about it, except it was <span class="allsmcap">EAST O’
THE SUN AND WEST O’ THE MOON</span>.</p>

<p>“And thither you’ll come, late or never, but you shall
have the loan of my horse to my next neighbour; maybe
she’ll tell you all about it; and when you get there, just
switch the horse under the left ear, and beg him to be off
home.”</p>

<p>And this old hag gave her the golden carding-comb; it
might be she’d find the use for it, she said. So the lassie
got up on the horse, and rode a far far way, and a weary
time; and so at last she came to another great rock, under
which sat another old hag, spinning with a golden spinning-wheel.
Her, too, she asked if she knew the way to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">(328)</span>
Prince, and where the castle was, that lay <span class="allsmcap">EAST O’ THE
SUN AND WEST O’ THE MOON</span>. So it was the same thing
again.</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s you that ought to have had the Prince?”
said the old hag.</p>

<p>Yes, it was.</p>

<p>But she, too, didn’t know the way a bit better than the
other two. “<span class="smcap">East o’ the sun and west o’ the moon</span>
it was” she knew—that was all.</p>

<p>“And thither you’ll come late or never; but I’ll lend
you my horse, and then I think you’d best ride to the East
Wind and ask him; maybe he knows those parts, and can
blow you thither. But when you get to him, you need only
give the horse a switch under the left ear, and he’ll trot
home of himself.”</p>

<p>And so, too, she gave her the gold spinning-wheel.
“Maybe you’ll find a use for it,” said the old hag.</p>

<p>Then on she rode many many days, a weary time, before
she got to the East Wind’s house, but at last she did reach
it, and then she asked the East Wind if he could tell her the
way to the Prince who dwelt <span class="allsmcap">EAST O’ THE SUN AND WEST
O’ THE MOON</span>. Yes, the East Wind had often heard tell of
it, the Prince, and the Castle, but he couldn’t tell the way,
for he had never blown so far.</p>

<p>“But, if you will, I’ll go with you to my brother the
West Wind, maybe he knows, for he’s much stronger. So,
if you will just get on my back, I’ll carry you thither.”</p>

<p>Yes, she got on his back, and I should just think they
went briskly along.</p>

<p>So when they got there, they went into the West Wind’s
house, and the East Wind said the lassie he had brought was
the one who ought to have had the Prince who lived in the
castle <span class="allsmcap">EAST O’ THE SUN AND WEST O’ THE MOON</span>; and so she
had set out to seek him, and how he had come with her,
and would be glad to know if the West Wind knew how to
get to the castle.</p>

<p>“Nay,” said the West Wind, “so far I’ve never blown;
but if you will I’ll go with you to our brother the South<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">(329)</span>
Wind, for he’s much stronger than either of us, and he has
flapped his wings far and wide. Maybe he’ll tell you. You
can get on my back and I’ll carry you to him.”</p>

<p>Yes! she got on his back, and so they travelled to the
South Wind, and weren’t so very long on the way, I should
think.</p>

<p>When they got there, the West Wind asked him if he
could tell her the way to the castle that lay <span class="allsmcap">EAST O’ THE
SUN AND WEST O’ THE MOON</span>, for it was she that ought to
have had the Prince who lived there.</p>

<p>“You don’t say so. That’s she, is it?” said the South
Wind. “Well, I have blustered about in most places in my
time, but so far have I never blown; but if you will, I’ll
take you to my brother the North Wind; he is the oldest
and the strongest of the whole lot of us, and if he don’t
know where it is, you’ll never find anyone in the world to
tell you. You can get on my back, and I’ll carry you
thither.”</p>

<p>Yes! she got on his back, and away he went from his
house at a fine rate, and this time, too, she wasn’t long on
her way.</p>

<p>So when they got to the North Wind’s house, he was
so wild and cross, cold puffs came from him a long way
off.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Now then, what do you want?</span>” he bawled out to
them ever so far off, so that it struck them with an icy
shiver.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the South Wind, “you needn’t be so put
out, for here I am, your brother, the South Wind, and
here is the lassie who ought to have had the Prince who
dwells in the castle that lies <span class="allsmcap">EAST O’ THE SUN AND WEST O’
THE MOON</span>, and now she wants to ask you if you ever
were there, and can tell her the way, for she would be
so glad to find him again.”</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Yes, I know well enough where it is</span>,” said the
North Wind; “once in my life I blew an aspen-leaf
thither, but I was so tired I couldn’t blow a puff for
ever so many days after it. But if you really wish to go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">(330)</span>
thither, and aren’t afraid to come along with me, I’ll take
you on my back and see if I can blow you thither.”</p>

<p>Yes! with all her heart; she must and would get
thither if it were possible in any way, and as for fear,
however madly he went, she wouldn’t be at all afraid.</p>

<p>“Very well then,” said the North Wind, “but you must
sleep here to-night, for we must have the whole day
before us if we’re to get there at all.”</p>

<p>Early next morning the North Wind woke her, and
puffed himself up and blew himself out, and made himself
so stout and big, ’twas gruesome to look at him;
and so off they went, high up through the air, as if they
would never stop till they got to the world’s end.</p>

<p>Down here below there was such a storm; it threw
down long tracts of wood and many houses, and when
it swept over the great sea ships foundered by hundreds.</p>

<p>So they tore on and on—no one can believe how far
they went—and all the while they still went over the sea,
and the North Wind got more and more weary, and so
out of breath he could scarce bring out a puff, and his
wings drooped and drooped, till at last he sunk so low
that the crests of the waves dashed over his heels.</p>

<p>“Are you afraid?” said the North Wind.</p>

<p>No! she wasn’t.</p>

<p>But they weren’t very far from land; and the North
Wind had still so much strength left in him that he
managed to throw her up on the shore under the windows
of the castle which lay <span class="allsmcap">EAST O’ THE SUN AND WEST O’ THE
MOON</span>; but then he was so weak and worn out, he had
to stay there and rest many days before he could get
home again.</p>

<p>Next morning the lassie sat down under the castle
window and began to play with the gold apple; and the
first person she saw was the Long-nose who was to have
the Prince.</p>

<p>“What do you want for your gold apple, you lassie?”
said the Long-nose, and threw up the window.</p>

<p>“It’s not for sale for gold or money,” said the lassie.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">(333)</span></p>

<p>“If it’s not for sale for gold or money, what is it that
you will sell it for? You may name your own price,”
said the Princess.</p>

<p>“Well, if I may get to the Prince who lives here and
be with him to-night, you shall have it,” said the lassie
whom the North Wind had brought.</p>

<p>Yes! she might; that could be done. So the Princess
got the gold apple; but when the lassie came up to the
Prince’s bedroom at night he was fast asleep; she called
him and shook him, and between whiles she wept sore;
but all she could do she couldn’t wake him up. Next
morning, as soon as day broke, came the Princess with
the long nose and drove her out again.</p>

<p>So in the daytime she sat under the castle windows and
began to card with her golden carding-comb, and the
same thing happened. The Princess asked what she
wanted for it; and she said it wasn’t for sale for gold or
money, but if she might get leave to go up to the Prince
and be with him that night, the Princess should have it.
But when she went up, she found him fast asleep again,
and all she called, and all she shook, and wept, and
prayed, she couldn’t get life into him; and as soon as
the first gray peep of day came, then came the Princess
with the long nose and chased her out again.</p>

<p>So, in the daytime, the lassie sat down outside under
the castle window and began to spin with her golden
spinning-wheel, and that, too, the Princess with the long
nose wanted to have. So she threw up the window and
asked what she wanted for it. The lassie said, as she
had said twice before, it wasn’t for sale for gold or money;
but if she might go up to the Prince who was there, and
be with him alone that night, she might have it.</p>

<p>Yes! she might do that and welcome. But now you
must know there were some folk who had been carried
off thither, and as they sat in their room, which was next
the Prince, they had heard how a woman had been in
there, and wept and prayed, and called to him two nights
running, and they told that to the Prince.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">(334)</span></p>

<p>That evening, when the Princess came with her sleepy
drink, the Prince made as if he drank, but threw it over
his shoulder, for he could guess it was a sleepy drink.
So, when the lassie came in, she found the Prince wide
awake; and then she told him the whole story how she
had come thither.</p>

<p>“Ah,” said the Prince, “you’ve just come in the very
nick of time for to-morrow is to be our wedding-day; but
now I won’t have the Long-nose, and you are the only
woman in the world who can set me free. I’ll say I
want to see what my wife is fit for, and beg her to wash
the shirt which has the three spots of tallow on it; she’ll
say yes, for she doesn’t know ’tis you who put them there;
but that’s a work only for Christian folk, and not for such
a pack of Trolls, and so I’ll say that I won’t have any
other for my bride than the woman who can wash them
out, and ask you to do it.”</p>

<p>So there was great joy and love between them all that
night. But next day, when the wedding was to be, the
Prince said:—</p>

<p>“First of all I’d like to see what my bride is fit for.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the stepmother, with all her heart.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the Prince, “I’ve got a fine shirt which I’d
like for my wedding-shirt, but somehow or other it has got
three spots of tallow on it, which I must have washed out;
and I have sworn never to take any other bride than the
woman who’s able to do that. If she can’t she’s not
worth having.”</p>

<p>Well, that was no great thing, they said, so they
agreed, and she with the Long-nose began to wash away
as hard as she could, but the more she rubbed and
scrubbed, the bigger the spots grew.</p>

<p>“Ah,” said the old hag, her mother, “you can’t wash;
let me try.”</p>

<p>But she hadn’t long taken the shirt in hand, before it
got far worse than ever, and with all her rubbing, and
wringing, and scrubbing the spots grew bigger and blacker,
and the darker and uglier was the shirt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">(335)</span></p>

<p>Then all the other trolls began to wash, but the longer
it lasted the blacker and uglier the shirt grew, till at last it
was as black all over as if it had been up the chimney.</p>

<p>“Ah,” said the Prince, “you’re none of you worth a
straw; you can’t wash. Why there, outside, sits a beggar
lassie, I’ll be bound she knows how to wash better than
the whole lot of you. Come in, lassie,” he shouted.</p>

<p>Well, in she came.</p>

<p>“Can you wash this shirt clean, lassie, you?” said he.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” she said, “but I think I can.”</p>

<p>And almost before she had taken it and dipped it in
the water, it was as white as driven snow, and whiter still.</p>

<p>“Yes; you are the lassie for me,” said the Prince.</p>

<p>At that the old hag flew into such a rage she burst on
the spot, and the Princess with the long nose after her,
and the whole pack of Trolls after her—at least I’ve
never heard a word about them since.</p>

<p>As for the Prince and Princess, they set free all the poor
folk who had been carried off and shut up there, and they
took with them all the silver and gold, and flitted away as
far as they could from the castle that lay <span class="allsmcap">EAST O’ THE
SUN AND WEST O’ THE MOON</span>.</p>

<p>When the song was finished Oberon and Titania arose
on their throne and faint strains of music were heard in
the air; for a moment the whole place sparkled with light
and colour, and then all the fairies had gone in a flash to
their distant places, and nothing but a faint circle of
darker grass showed where the great assembly had been.
Away under a shady tree Nick Bottom and his companions
were fast asleep, and when they awakened again they must
have puzzled over what they had seen and heard, and
which no doubt they believed that they had only dreamed.
But we know better.</p>
